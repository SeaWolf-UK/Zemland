Last known destination point for [[2. NPCs/Allies/Jasmine\|Jasmine]] Donjon

Called Dim Harbour because it is always gloomy, cloudy. Extends for a couple of miles round the town.

Lots of storms within whilst at sea.

Their lighthouse has been out of commission for a couple of weeks.

No ships have been able to enter or leave the harbour.
