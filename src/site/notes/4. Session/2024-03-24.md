## Session 8

#### Roll Call
[[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] 
[[1. PC's/Kori\|Kori]] 
[[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] 
[[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] 
[[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] 

We have nothing else for the vampire spawn and release her, with the warning that this will be the last time we will be merciful if we see any more.

He head back to the hamlet.

[[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] "confronts" her parents.  
- I say confronts, she asks what is this about, they give some level of BS, and it's accepted.  
	- Mother says she hired someone to watch [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] siblings. 
		- But why does that mean that they are in debt?  They are, supposedly,  loaded, why the hell do they need to go into debt, to a thieves guild or worse.  
		- How does this link to the bodies movers (notes [[4. Session/2024-03-17\|2024-03-17]]) to let them go without any issues (remember father was lying through his teeth). 
		- Not convinced to say the least.

They know something about [[3. Locations/Town/Dim Harbour\|Dim Harbour]]  but don't want to tell anyone..........
- Get the feeling that they may not like their daughter as they seem to be constantly keeping information away from her which will help her, or keep her alive. 
	- I can understand why they want to see the end of their daughter though.

[[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] shows the gems that steal souls we retrieved from the necromancers tower, to his father who doesn't bat an eyelid.  
- So rather than show it to her mother who is a mage of some description, she gives it to her father who isn't - hey ho.
- ![Facepalm240324.webp|500 ](/img/user/z_Attachments/Facepalm240324.webp)
	- Again, I'm really going to run out of facepalm images

Spend the night and leave the next morning and head towards [[3. Locations/Town/Dim Harbour\|Dim Harbour]] .

Thunderstorm appears out of no where as we approach the town.

[[3. Locations/Town/Dim Harbour\|Dim Harbour]] 
- Very quiet as we enter the town.
	- As we go deeper into the town.
		- A riot is going on.
		- Halfling trying to calm everyone down.
			- No-one listens.
			- ![HalflinginDimHarbour.webp|500](/img/user/z_Attachments/HalflinginDimHarbour.webp)
		- No ships can come in or leave until the lighthouse is fixed.
[[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] goes to speak to the Halfling.
- [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] asks about lighthouse.
	- He offers us to go fix it for them.
		- The halfling says that they are willing to pay (Kerching).
		- Needs to speak to mayor to confirm amount.
		- Will come to see us in the tavern after his conversation with the mayor.

We head to the only tavern in town.
![WhisperingWavesInn.webp|500](/img/user/z_Attachments/WhisperingWavesInn.webp)

	- Get rooms, food, drinks.
		- Bleeding expensive
- [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] speaks to the bar tender and asks about the lighthouse.
	- Been out of commission for a few weeks.
	- Captain Elara normally fixes it but has disappeared.
		- Last seen when she returned from the lighthouse.
			- The light stayed on for a few days then went out.
			- Curse of the lighthouse or curse of the sea.
		- She was/is Captain of the Marionette.
			- Apparently this is a semi-famous ship and captain.
				- Never heard of her or it...


We discuss actions and agree on a plan oof going to the lighthouse and scouting the area, and under no circumstances enter, investigate further, etc.  Just get an idea of what may be happening.
- **ALL AGREE** (this is important)

We go to lighthouse to scout the area.
![LightHouse.webp|500](/img/user/z_Attachments/LightHouse.webp)
- The lighthouse is called Beacon's End.
	- Scout the outside
		- Nothing of note.
		- 2 story lighthouse.
		- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] and [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] enter the building.
			- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] and [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] hear a girls voice in the lighthouse.
			- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] and [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] want to explorer the whole lighthouse and underneath now.  Sod the agreed plan.
			- Stairs leading down.
			- Stairs up behind a closed, locked door.
			- Signs of panic throughout the lighthouse.
			- Rotten food on table.
			- Fire has embers in it.
			- The rest of use see a level of sense and stay outside.
				- The agreed plan was to scout the site, and then go to shop, and gear up for the lighthouse when we know what we are potentially up against.
					- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] and [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] insist that we do it now, not knowing what we will face and ill equipped.
					- This is not what **WE ALL AGREED UPON**
						- I do appreciate [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]'s words and her desire to help the people of [[3. Locations/Town/Dim Harbour\|Dim Harbour]] , but we are ill prepared/equipped at this point, and this is not a situation where people are in immediate danger.
						- A sentiment echoed by [[1. PC's/Kori\|Kori]].
							- This guy was initially a pain, but he seems to be more of a like mind.
				- Strangely, in a show of unity and clear thinking, [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] , [[1. PC's/Kori\|Kori]] and [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] insist that we do not do that and stick to the plan.
				- [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  almost sees sense and stays.
				- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] being the muppet she is, goes down stairs.
					- ![Muppet.webp|500](/img/user/z_Attachments/Muppet.webp)
					- For the love of the gods, she is a total liability.
						- She will get us all killed.
				- [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]], [[1. PC's/Kori\|Kori]] , [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] say screw this and leave [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] to die, get hurt, pick her nose whatever - we've just about had enough.
					- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] is supposed to be our "leader" - though no-one agreed to, or voted for this.
						- Just like that feckin stupid group name.
						- Yet she is acting like a spoilt brat and doing whatever she wants, no matter how that affects the rest of the group.
							- Personally I say, let her do whatever she wants and we stay back and watch her get eviscerated.
							- I know I ([[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]) will not go out of my way to help her going forward unless she radically changes her methods and attitude..

The sensible party members go shopping to prep for the lighthouse.

We go shopping and buy lots of stuff for really cheap - I know we're experienced negotiators but holy feck.....

We go back to the tavern.

[[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] goes and speaks to the Tavern owner.

					- [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] tries to lift it but is unable to.
					- The rest of use have no hope in the hells to lift it then.
	- We decide to go down - ooh err misses.
		- Hear footsteps, light as a child and others more heavy.
		- Come into a dungeon complex.
			- Yay more bleeding ***TUNNELS***.

		- [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] calls out to the spirits.
			- No reply.

		 - Come to a set of 5 levers in the wall.
		 - ![Leversonawall.webp|500](/img/user/z_Attachments/Leversonawall.webp)
			 - [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  pulls lever 3 without asking anyone ([[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]) to check for traps.

		- ***ARRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH***
			- [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] voices his displeasure at [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] 

Come to room with cages.

				- She needs to change her attitude or there will be consequences.

Kax mentions that he needs to leave soon to undertake some task.

In the meantime, [[1. PC's/Kori\|Kori]] and [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] also have doppelgangers of the others - so now 2 full parties - original and doppelgangers.
- [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] marks the dopplegangers with a D.
- [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  give each of the real people an armband as a double check.

It is decided that it may be better to keep the doppelgangers with us as we know where they are, and also to use as cannon fodder. 

[[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]]  leaves for whatever he needs to do.

End of Session.
