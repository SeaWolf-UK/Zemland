## Session 2


#### Roll Call 

[[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] 
[[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] 
[[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] 
[[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] 
[[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] 


We are awoken by a screaming individual.

Laying on the ground is one of the cultists with [[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Allies/Shadow\|Shadow]] bending over them comforting them.

Once the cultist has calmed, [[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Allies/Shadow\|Shadow]] goes to [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] and they have a conversation.:
- "We have to Stop this."
- "We need the resources."

Ella comes to the group and says that she has some jobs for us.
- Needs supplies, food, drink etc.
	- [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] will get these as the thought of going outside of the city does not agree with her.
- Needs herbs from the forest.
	- Blue flower.
		- It is an anti-septic
			- Calacoria / Slipper Flower.
		- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] & [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] know that the flower can be found in damp woodlands
	- [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] will pay 10gp per flower returned

We are introduced to a new party member [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] (aka Kax).  Kax is a [[compendium/classes/sorcerer\|sorcerer]].

[[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]], [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]], [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] & [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] go to the woods.

The 4 find a small clearing with 4 bushes of the flowers, but there are some wolf tracks nearby.

As they approach the bushes some wolves attack the party, combat starts.  The party are victorious, but [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] takes a kicking again.

The party get 3 wearable wolf pelts from the encounter, and some meat for the less well off in the [[5. Lore/Organisations/Cult of Tiamat\|Cult of Tiamat]].

Whilst they are out in the woods playing Robyn Hood and killing poor defenceless wolves, I go into the most dangerous place in the city - the market.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. I must be cautious.

I find a stall selling produce.  And use my vast skill at negotiation and buy them out for 6gp (these are poor farmers so stealing from them doesn't sit right).

I move on to see what else is around.  I find another stall, this one seems a bit better off - they even have a couple of slaves, Red [[compendium/races/dragonborn\|dragonborn]].  This is odd especially Red's.  I speak to them and apparently their family owe a lot of money and sold them to clear the debt.  I speak to the stall owner and again negotiate a lower price for the whole stall.  13gp as the produce if of a higher quality.

I return to the warehouse with the goods.  [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] says this is the most food and drink they have seen since they have been in the city.

Around this time, the merry men return.  They produce the flowers, and [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] pays out 140gp.  [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] says that he doesn't want any money so I offer to hold his share for him.

I go to speak to Ella.  Asking her to let us in more, give us some real jobs etc.
- Ella is trying to keep the cult together.  
- She came to help people 
- Secrets are being buried in the city.
- Plans are being made by an undercover organisation 
- Corruption in the city is extensive.
- I ask about the screaming cultist from this morning.
	- She was trying to get information from the Golden Quarter.
	- She was caught whilst going to the [[3. Locations/City/Dragontail/Districts/Golden Quarter/Ivory Citadel\|Ivory Citadel]] 
	- She was trying to get info on the secret society that controls the city.
	- Apparently [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] Uncle is involved in some way.
	- [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] Uncle is known to pass notes and information to someone in this society 
	- We are warned to keep an eye out for suspicious behaviour and to watch the coming and going of the uncle and visitors to his Manson 

[[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]]  and [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]], as one does, at the temple of the Sleeping Defiler!!!!!  Temple to the god of death, [[Giathices\|Giathices]].
- [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] speaks to the High priest.
	- She shows his sword (ohh err misses)
	- She says the sword has a name - Deathbound (not ominous in the slightest.)
	- She says the the sword "Ate" his Bardic talent.
	- The high priest says that Archibald may be able to help with the cursed weapon - cursed, oh FFS.
	- Archibald can be found in Dim Harbour

As mass is about to start the pair leave the temple.

The pair head back to the warehouse, where [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] is laying on hands to the cultist that is screaming in order to purge the poison from the body.

I ask [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] what actually happened.
- The cultists name is [[2. NPCs/Neutral/Flower\|Flower]] 
- They were trying to obtain information 
	- Went to the Golden Quarter.
	- The Drow that i met earlier gave her information that led [[2. NPCs/Neutral/Flower\|Flower]]  into an ambush

I speak to [[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Allies/Shadow\|Shadow]] (these cultists really need to get more inventive with their names).

He says that the warehouse has too many ears and eyes and we agree to meet later at a nearby tavern, The Bald Eagle.
- We ask [[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Allies/Shadow\|Shadow]]  about [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] 
	- She is out of control.
	- He says that he was not originally a member 
	- He was an outcast and outlaw following his dishonouring
	- Ella recruited him, promised him the world and more.
	- She and he did all for the people
	- Within a couple of years she had changed.
	- Her methods gradually became more extreme
	- When asked for examples.
		- She brought back a noble/well off.
		- She tortured them to get the information.
	- The [[5. Lore/Organisations/Cult of Tiamat\|Cult of Tiamat]] was not supposed to come to [[3. Locations/City/Dragontail\|Dragontail]] 
	- Ella was told to come to [[3. Locations/City/Dragontail\|Dragontail]] to obtain info about corrupt nobles within the city
	- Been here for 12 months+ - not the couple of weeks as advised by [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] uncle.
	- Her actions are hindering helping of the innocents and the needy.
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Allies/Shadow\|Shadow]] says that [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] is trying to bring something into the [[compendium/backgrounds/city-watch-scag\|city-watch-scag]] The Kobald is Loyal.
	- Planning something that involves the tunnels

As we leave the Tavern I notice a shadowy figure on the rooftops, obviously following us.

I track the figure down and sneak up on them.  Turns out to be a [[compendium/races/elf-wood\|elf-wood]] with pale skin and is either unable to/or unwilling to speak.  Ella has sent her to follow us.  [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] is starting to annoy me.

[[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] and [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] go to see [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]]'s uncle.
- The uncle knows more than he is letting on
	- Ella also goes by the names:
		- [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Starlight\|Starlight]] 
		- [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Pariah\|Pariah]] 
		- [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Nightingale\|Nightingale]] 
	- Known to exploit the rich.
	- People have gone missing here in [[3. Locations/City/Dragontail\|Dragontail]] and other cities/towns before.
	- She has left her mark wherever she has gone.
	- Known to worship [[tiamat-rot \|Tiamat]] 
	- She sold herself to the wrong people and was chased out of various towns 
	- She brainwashes her followers

	- The Light Followers 

[[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] and [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] leave the manson.

Whilst [[1. PC's/Nigel Del La Plumph\|Nigel Del La Plumph]] and [[1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] are out, I speak to [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] and ask her what jobs she needs doing.

She has a number of jobs
- Clear out the tunnels (not something [[1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] relishes)
- People smuggling
	- The people smuggling and clearing out of the tunnels are linked.
		- The tunnels need clearing out before the person can be extracted
	- The person to be smuggled out of the city is well known.
	- She is a [[compendium/races/dragonborn\|dragonborn]] who has problems with her family and their ideals.
	- She will be placed in a safehouse whilst the tunnels are cleared.

I talk to the rest of the group when we all get back together, and they agree to clear the tunnels - oh joy.

We go to the tunnels.
- I hate tunnels/sewars.
- Hear a strange noise from one of the tunnels  - i suggest going the opposite direction.
- I hate tunnels/sewars.
- The group come up with a plan to place some [[compendium/items/oil-of-slipperiness\|oil-of-slipperiness]] on the entrance to the tunnel where the noise is coming from.
- As we prepare, the creature comes from another tunnel 
- I hate tunnels/sewars.
- Combat 
	- we defeat the creature 
	- Not before [[1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] manages to shoot [[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] in the back (I suggest we remove the bow from her)
- We continue.
- We come across a tunnel covered in cobwebs.
- I hate tunnels/sewars.

- Combat 
	- We defeat the [[compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider\|giant-spider]] 
	- not before the spider climbs over everyone to get to me and gives me a big bite.
	- ***I HATE TUNNELS/SEWARS.**

We get to the end of the tunnels and emerge about 1 mile south-west of the city - this is where we are to bring the [[compendium/races/dragonborn\|dragonborn]] from the golden quarter.

We go back through he tunnels to the warehouse.

[[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] is writing in her journal.  When finished she locks it in a secure chest.

She goes out through the "secret" passage at the rear of the alter.

	- If she fails again she will die.
	- [[2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] bows down to them.
- She returns to the warehouse.

We settle down for the night.
