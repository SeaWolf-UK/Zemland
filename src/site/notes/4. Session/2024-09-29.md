## Session 31

#### Roll Call

[[1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] - Half-Elf Sorcerer
[[1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]] - Gnome Druid
[[1. PC's/Grulk Frostblood\|Grulk Frostblood]] - Gobline Barbarian

[[1. PC's/Xadira\|Xadira]] - Human Range.

## Recap
In the last session, the party took on the whimsical yet perilous Pie Caper. While waiting for their companions in Dragontail, the group chose a seemingly simple job to recover a stolen festival pie from the village of Crustward. Upon arrival, chaos ensued when the mayor met an unfortunate fate due to a trap, and Grulk "persuaded" the new mayor to send villagers to clear the way. The adventurers stormed the bandits' fort, battling not only bandits but animated doughballs and mighty pastry golems. Despite mishaps, including Grulk’s temper and Kax's fiery mistakes, the party emerged victorious, retrieved the pie, and ended up taking over the village of Crustward.

### **Session 31: The Cursed Mask, Dark Visions, and Grulk’s Wrath Unleashed**

---

### **The Party of Fools:**

- **Workax Dreyman**—half-elf sorcerer, always pokin' and proddin' at magic, thinkin' he’s smarter than the rest of us. Clever, but weak. Needs **Grulk** to watch his back more often than not.
- **Wentri Sporesnore**—gnome druid, more interested in plants and potions than swingin' a proper weapon. His magic’s useful in a pinch, but he’s got the sturdiness of a soggy mushroom.
- **Eldrin Greenwalker**—the elf druid who turns into all sorts of beasts. Not bad with his spells, but he’s no fighter. **Grulk** has had to save his pointy-eared hide more than once.
- **Xadira**—human ranger with a sharp eye and a sharper tongue. She prefers the shadows, takin' aim with her bow from a distance. Doesn’t quite fight like **Grulk**, but she knows how to get the job done.
- **Pim**—the halfling monk, always lost in his own thoughts, tryin' to be noble or some nonsense. Quick with his fists, but not nearly quick enough to keep out of trouble. Good thing **Grulk** is always there to pull him out.
- And then there’s **me—Grulk Frostblood**. The goblin with the heart and rage of a **Frost Giant**. When I rage, I grow to **12 feet** of fury and strength. **Me axe**, which normally drags behind me like a burden too big for a goblin, becomes like a mere **hand axe** in my massive grip.

---

### **Back in the Rune Chamber (Where Grulk Starts to Get Bored)**

We were still in that **Rune Chamber**, where we had been tellin’ tales of **Crustward’s pie caper**. It was a fine tale of **Grulk’s** mighty triumphs, but it was time to get back to the task at hand. 

**Pim** jolted awake from a deep sleep, eyes wide and breathin' hard. Seemed he was haunted by somethin’ in his dreams, but **Grulk** didn’t care much for what ghosts troubled the little monk. 

**Kax**, ever the magic-tinkerer, started playin’ with the **astrolabe** on the altar, alignin’ its lenses to the constellations. He muttered somethin’ about it bein’ able to **see the future, teleport us**, or even **reverse time** once a month. Aye, tricks of magic, but would it smash a foe in half? No, that was **Grulk’s** job.

**Pim** eyed the **masks** layin' on the altar, but he couldn’t make sense of ‘em. **Eldrin**, the smart elf, examined them and declared they represented **Death** (the **white mask**), **Divine** (the **gold mask**), and **Life** (the **silver mask**). 

“**Why don’t we fix ‘em and wear ‘em?**” **Xadira** suggested, always with ideas that dance close to danger. 

**Eldrin** tried his best to piece ‘em together, but the fool fumbled. The masks slipped from his hands and fell apart again. **Grulk** crossed his arms, growlin’. “*If ye can’t fix somethin’, break it,*” he muttered to himself.

---

### **The Cursed Mask (Where Grulk's Patience Runs Thin)**

We tried puttin’ various magic items on the **altar**, seein' if anythin' would happen. They floated above it, but nothin' of note occurred. Then, we placed the **masks** onto the altar, and they **glowed** brightly, sendin' out a **sonic boom** that rattled the walls. The masks **fused into one**—an ominous, glimmerin' mask.

“**I’ll try it!**” declared **Kax**, ever the fool. Before anyone could stop him, he grabbed the mask and **slapped it onto his face**. In a heartbeat, it **fused to his skin**, tight as a second layer, not comin’ off. He clawed at it, but the damn thing stayed put.

“**Ye fool, what’ve ye done now?**” I barked. **Xadira** picked up the **book** nearby, readin’ its cursed words. 

“**It’s a curse,**” she said. “*Those who wear the silver mask become bound to it, eventually wanderin’ the world as mindless husks.*” And o' course, the pages about the other masks were **ripped out**. *Great,* I thought. Now we had a cursed sorcerer on our hands.

---

### **Grulk Takes Action (Where the Chamber Collapses)**

After much blabberin' about what to do, **Pim** suggested usin' the **astrolabe** to teleport us to his monastery, claimin’ they might know how to remove the mask. More monks, more talkin'... **Grulk** was already bored.

But before we could act, **Kax** climbed up onto the altar and **laid down**. The mask **glowed** brighter than ever. “**Grulk, do somethin’!**” they yelled.

“**Fine! Move aside!**” I snarled, marchin’ up to the altar with the shard in hand. I placed it onto the mask, and **BANG!** The damn thing **shattered**, fragments flyin' in every direction. At least I was **doin' somethin'**.

But then the **chamber rumbled**, stones crashin’ down from the ceiling. 

“**RUN!**” I bellowed, **me voice echoing** through the chamber. We sprinted for the exit as the walls began to collapse around us.

Suddenly, a **massive boulder** fell, trappin’ **Wentri Sporesnore** underneath. “**DAMN IT!**” I roared, rushin’ over. With a mighty heave, I lifted the rock off his pathetic gnome body, tossin’ it aside. 

“**Move yer legs, mushroom-head!**” I growled, yankin’ him up as we continued our mad dash.

---

### **Pie-Induced Nightmares (Where Grulk Faces Himself)**

We escaped the ruin, hearts poundin' and stomachs churnin'. Starvin', we dug into one of those **Crustward pies**, forgettin' the damned mushrooms mixed in. Before we knew it, we were out cold, fallin' into a **drug-induced coma**.

When I awoke, we found ourselves in a twisted **dreamscape**, surrounded by **mirrors** reflectin' our twisted selves back at us. **Eldrin** touched his mirror, and his reflection **grinned** like a demon. The others followed:
- **Grulk’s reflection** grinned back, full o’ teeth that could chew through iron.
- **Pim’s reflection** laughed, eyes glintin' with mockery.
- **Xadira’s** looked fearful, as if starin' at her own doom.

**Xadira** stepped closer to her mirror, drawn into a nightmare from her past. She stood in a **burning forest**, **dolls hangin’ from the trees**, their faces twisted and melted. A **figure** appeared, grabbin’ her wrist, whisperin', "You left me." Roots erupted from the ground, **graspin' and burnin'** her skin, but she managed to break free, shoved back through the mirror which **shattered** into pieces.

She rejoined us, eyes wild with fear. 

“**Bloody cursed mirrors,**” I growled, fists clenchin'. “**Let’s smash ‘em and be done with it.**”

---

### **Visions and Screams (Where Grulk Grows Restless)**

Next up was **Eldrin**. He stared into his mirror and found himself flyin' as a **bat** over a battlefield, a **giant** loomin' in the distance. A **hammer** swung down, and his mirror **shattered**.

“**Bah, more nonsense,**” I grumbled, grip tightening on me axe. “**Show me somethin’ worth fightin’!**”

**Pim** took his turn, seein' himself wander through **dark tunnels**, hearin' whispers. He found a **dead end**, where he begged, "Please, don’t do this!" An **eldritch blast** hit him, sendin' him flyin'. His mirror shattered into dust.

---

### **The Cathedral of Nightmares (Where Grulk Fights the Beast)**

We walked forward through the dreamscape, enterin' a **tunnel** that felt alive, like the inside of some **giant beast's belly**. “**Are we crawlin' through a creature’s arse?**” I muttered as we pushed forward. We emerged into a **cathedral** that could only be a nightmare made real.

**Skulls and bones** littered the floor, and a **throne of sinew** sat in the center. Above it hung a

 **beating heart**, and the air was pierced by a **high-pitched scream** that nearly split our skulls open.

From the shadows emerged a **multi-limbed horror**, with **spider-like arms**, **dozens of mouths**, and **countless eyes**. 

“**FINALLY!**” I roared, feelin' the **rage** rise within me. My body grew, muscles swellin' as I transformed into a **12-foot-tall war god**. I charged at the beast, **axe raised high**, swingin' with all me strength.

**SWOOSH!** The damned creature **dodged**, quick as a shadow. But **Grulk** never gives up. I swung again, bringin' me axe down with a force that **split the ground** beneath us. This time, I **hit**—black ichor splattered everywhere, and the beast let out a screech that rattled the bones on the floor.

---

### **The Others Join the Fray (Where Grulk Does the Real Work)**

**Xadira** fired arrows from the shadows, each one **strikin'** the creature’s hide. The beast screamed again, tryin’ to claw at our minds with its endless voices. It lunged at me, its eyes burnin' into my skull, and I felt a **sharp pain** cut through my mind.

“**AARRGGHHH!**” I bellowed, clutchin' me head for a brief moment. But pain only made **Grulk** angrier. 

**Eldrin** cast **fairy fire**, tryin' to light up the creature, but it shrugged off the spell like nothin'. 

“**Useless!**” I barked, as I prepared another swing.

**Kax** whipped out his **wand of fear**, pointin' it at the beast, but it only **laughed**, its mouths openin' wide to mock his efforts. **Pim** charged in, landin' a few blows with his fists, but it was like hittin' stone.

---

### **Grulk’s Rage (Where Grulk Ends It)**

Growlin’ with fury, I swung me axe again, **smashin’** into the beast’s body. It shrieked, tremblin' under the force of my attack. It tried to retaliate, claws flashin' toward me, but I **blocked** with the shaft of my axe, knockin’ its limbs aside.

“**I’ll END YE!**” I roared, liftin’ me axe for one final strike. With a mighty swing, I brought it down with such force that the floor **cracked** beneath us. The creature let out a **horrible scream** as it was **cleaved in half**, its many mouths fallin' silent.

---

### **The Aftermath (Where Grulk Wants More)**

As the beast died, the **floor** began to **collapse**, and a door appeared out of nowhere. We **ran through it**, escapin’ the nightmare and wakin' up in the real world, sweat-soaked and hearts poundin'.

The others groaned, cursin' the pie for its effects. But **Grulk**? 

“**Best fight I’ve had in ages!**” I bellowed, hungerin' for more. This was the thrill **Grulk** lived for.

---

### **Visions and the Return to the Monastery (Where Grulk Cleaves a Monk)**

In the aftermath, strange gifts were granted to us:
- **Grulk** received **true sight**.
- **Eldrin** gained insight into the **past**.
- **Pim** felt a **soul-bound awakening**.
- **Xadira** learned to **shadow step**.
- **Kax** received a **tome of lost words**.

We retraced our steps, makin' our way back to the office where we first entered this damned complex. **Kax** found letters in **thieves' cant**, mentionin' **Pim** as a troublemaker. Bah, nothin' new there.

After some yammerin', **Pim** used the **astrolabe** to teleport us to his monastery. We landed in a **courtyard**, overgrown with vines, lookin' abandoned. **Eldrin** turned into an **owl** to scout the area, spotttin' monks—six of ‘em, with one lookin' unnatural.

**Kax** approached them, lyin' through his teeth about knowin' where the **shard** was. They took him away for some **ritual**, and after a while, we saw **Pim** confrontin’ them. 

**Grulk** grew bored with the endless talkin’. “**Can I smash now?**” I kept askin' **Xadira**. Finally, the moment came: they tried to **corrupt Pim**, puttin' their filthy hands on him.

“**NOT TODAY!**” I roared, **raging** as I hurled me axe at the monk’s head. The blade flew true, **cleavin' the monk in two**, blood sprayin' everywhere. 

“**There, problem solved!**” I barked, **Grulk** standin' victorious once more.

---

### **The Ritual and the Aftermath (Where Grulk Plans the Next Battle)**

While **Pim** and **Eldrin** sneaked off to where **Kax** was gettin’ the mask removed, I stood watch. When they returned, **Kax** told us he’d tricked the monks, but they were still schemin' for artifacts and power. 

We decided we needed to retrieve the **mask pieces**, but when **Eldrin** and **Wentri** shapeshifted into **rats** and snuck back, they found the masks **gone**. They barely escaped as monks raised the alarm.

---

### **End of Session (Where Grulk Stands Ready for More)**

So there ye have it. **Grulk** fought, smashed, and saved the day once more, even as the monks continued their schemin'. We’ll be back, and next time, I’ll make sure they remember the wrath of **Grulk Frostblood**. The story ain’t over till **Grulk** says so, and I’m not finished yet!
