## Charter of the Obsidian Hand

Article I: Purpose and Jurisdiction

The Obsidian Hand, herein referred to as "The Hand," is established to oversee and regulate all activities related to theft, smuggling, and other forms of illicit procurement within the city of Dragons Tail and its surrounding territories. The Hand operates under a strict code to ensure the success and security of its members while maintaining a delicate balance of power within the city's underworld.

 Article II: Membership

1. Eligibility and Initiation:
- Membership in The Hand is granted only to those who have proven their skill, discretion, and loyalty. Prospective members must undergo a period of apprenticeship under the guidance of a senior member, during which their abilities and trust worthiness will be assessed.
- Upon successful completion of the apprenticeship, the initiate will swear an oath of loyalty to The Hand and its leadership, binding them to the guild's rules and obligations.  

2. Dues and Contributions:
- All members are required to contribute 10% of the value of any goods, currency, or other assets acquired through their activities to The Hand. This contribution, known as "the tithe," ensures the continued operation and protection of the guild and its members.
- Failure to pay the tithe within the designated time will result in penalties, including but not limited to fines, suspension of guild privileges, or other disciplinary actions as deemed appropriate by the leadership.
 
Article III: Governance and Structure

  1. Council of Shadows:

- The Hand is governed by a Council of Shadows, composed of the most senior and influential members of the guild. The Council oversees all major decisions, including the allocation of resources, the arbitration of disputes, and the enforcement of guild laws.
 - The Council is led by the "Master of Shadows," who holds ultimate authority within The Hand. The Master of Shadows is responsible for maintaining the guild's operations and ensuring that all members adhere to the charter.
- A "Shadow Hand" serves as the second-in-command (2IC) to the Master of Shadows, acting as the vice president of the guild. The Shadow Hand is responsible for assisting the Master of Shadows in their duties, taking charge in their absence, and ensuring the smooth operation of the guild on a day-to-day basis. The Shadow Hand also has the authority to make decisions on behalf of The Hand when immediate action is required.

2. Ranks and Titles:
    
- Members of The Hand are organized into ranks based on their experience, skill, and contributions to the guild. These ranks include, but are not limited to, Initiate, Shadow, Whisper, and Phantom. Advancement within the guild is determined by the Council of Shadows and is based on merit and loyalty.
- Specific titles may be granted to members with specialized roles, such as "Keeper of Coin" (responsible for managing guild finances) or "Keeper of Secrets" (responsible for intelligence and covert operations).
    
Article IV: Conduct and Discipline

 1. Loyalty and Secrecy:
 - Members of The Hand are expected to maintain the highest level of loyalty to the guild. Betrayal of the guild or its members, including sharing secrets or colluding with outside forces, is punishable by death.
- Secrecy is paramount. Members must not reveal their affiliation with The Hand to anyone outside the guild without explicit permission from the Council of Shadows.

2. Unauthorized Operations:
- Any individual found conducting unauthorized criminal activities within The Hand's territory, without guild membership or approval, will be subject to severe punishment. Penalties for such offenses include the confiscation of assets, physical retribution, or execution, depending on the severity of the transgression.
 
3. Internal Disputes:
 - Disputes between members must be brought before the Council of Shadows for arbitration. Members are forbidden from settling disputes through violence or other unsanctioned means. The Council's decisions are final and binding.

Article V: Duty to the City and Surrounding Area

1. Protection of Dragons Tail:
 - The Hand recognizes the importance of maintaining the stability and prosperity of Dragons Tail and its surrounding territories. In times of danger or crisis, The Hand shall act in the best interest of the city and its people, using its resources and influence to protect the city from threats both internal and external.
 - The Hand may coordinate with other organizations, including those outside the law, to ensure the safety and continued operation of the city. While The Hand’s primary focus remains its own interests, the well-being of Dragons Tail is paramount to ensuring those interests can thrive.
 
2. Strategic Alliances:
 - The Hand may form temporary alliances with other factions or entities within the city to combat common threats. Such alliances must be approved by the Master of Shadows or the Shadow Hand and should be entered with caution to avoid compromising the guild’s secrecy and autonomy.
