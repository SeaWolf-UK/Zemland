## Charter of The Silent Eye

Article I: Purpose and Jurisdiction

The Silent Eye, herein referred to as "The Eye," is established to oversee and regulate all activities related to espionage, intelligence gathering, and covert surveillance within the city of Dragons Tail and its surrounding territories. The Eye operates under a strict code to ensure the accuracy, secrecy, and effectiveness of its members while maintaining the balance of power within the city and beyond.

Article II: Membership

1. Eligibility and Initiation:
- Membership in The Eye is reserved for those who demonstrate exceptional skill in the arts of espionage, disguise, and intelligence gathering. Prospective members must undergo a rigorous initiation process, which includes a series of trials designed to test their abilities, loyalty, and discretion.
- Upon successful completion of these trials, the initiate will swear an oath of loyalty to The Eye and its leadership, binding them to the guild's rules and obligations.

2. Dues and Contributions:
- All members are required to contribute 10% of the payment received from any sanctioned operation to The Eye. This contribution, known as the "intelligence fee," ensures the continued operation and protection of the guild and its members.
- Failure to pay the intelligence fee within the designated time will result in penalties, including but not limited to fines, suspension of guild privileges, or other disciplinary actions as deemed appropriate by the leadership.
    
Article III: Governance and Structure

 1. Council of Lenses:
 - The Eye is governed by the Council of Lenses, a body composed of the most experienced and skilled members of the guild. The Council oversees all major decisions, including the approval of missions, the allocation of resources, and the enforcement of guild laws.
 - The Council is led by the "Oracle," the head of The Eye, who holds ultimate authority within the guild. The Oracle is responsible for maintaining the guild's operations, ensuring that all members adhere to the charter, and making final decisions on all matters.
 - The "Lens" serves as the second-in-command (2IC) to the Oracle, acting as the vice president of the guild. The Lens is responsible for assisting the Oracle in their duties, taking charge in their absence, and ensuring the efficient operation of the guild on a day-to-day basis. The Lens also has the authority to make decisions on behalf of The Eye when immediate action is required.
    
2. Ranks and Titles:
- Members of The Eye are organized into ranks based on their experience, skill, and contributions to the guild. These ranks include, but are not limited to, Initiate, Observer, Watcher, and Seeker. Advancement within the guild is determined by the Council of Lenses and is based on merit and loyalty.
- Specific titles may be granted to members with specialized roles, such as "Keeper of Secrets" (responsible for managing the guild's intelligence network) or "Keeper of Shadows" (responsible for covert operations).

Article IV: Conduct and Discipline

1. Loyalty and Secrecy:
- Members of The Eye are expected to maintain the highest level of loyalty to the guild. Betrayal of the guild or its members, including sharing secrets or colluding with outside forces, is punishable by death.
- Secrecy is paramount. Members must not reveal their affiliation with The Eye to anyone outside the guild without explicit permission from the Council of Lenses.

2. Sanctioned Operations:
- Only operations sanctioned by the Council of Lenses may be undertaken by members of The Eye. Unauthorized surveillance, intelligence gathering, or other unsanctioned activities will result in severe punishment. Penalties for such offenses include the confiscation of assets, physical retribution, or execution, depending on the severity of the transgression.

3. Internal Disputes:
- Disputes between members must be brought before the Council of Lenses for arbitration. Members are forbidden from settling disputes through violence or other unsanctioned means. The Council's decisions are final and binding.
  
Article V: Duty to the City and Surrounding Area

1. Protection of Dragons Tail:
- The Eye recognizes the importance of maintaining the stability and prosperity of Dragons Tail and its surrounding territories. In times of danger or crisis, The Eye shall act in the best interest of the city and its people, using its resources and influence to protect the city from threats both internal and external.
- The Eye may coordinate with other organizations, including those outside the law, to ensure the safety and continued operation of the city. While The Eye’s primary focus remains its own interests, the well-being of Dragons Tail is paramount to ensuring those interests can thrive.
 
2. Strategic Alliances:
 - The Eye may form temporary alliances with other factions or entities within the city to combat common threats. Such alliances must be approved by the Oracle or the Lens and should be entered with caution to avoid compromising the guild’s secrecy and autonomy.
