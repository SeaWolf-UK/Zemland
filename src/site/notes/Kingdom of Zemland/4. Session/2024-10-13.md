[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]] - Gnome Druid
[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Grulk Frostblood\|Grulk Frostblood]] - [[Kingdom of Zemland/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin\|goblin]] Barbarian

## Recap

Last week, the party embarked on a daring quest to retrieve a powerful artifact near Wolf Fort, beginning with an unexpected encounter with a bumbling, spell-casting goose that nearly provoked Grulk Frostblood into attacking before Eldrin intervened. Successfully teleporting to Wolf Fort, they leveraged Workax Dreyman’s status as a Dragon Knight to intimidate the fort’s guards, securing access to both the captain’s luxurious quarters and the barracks where they enjoyed a sumptuous heroes' feast that bestowed temporary enhancements. Their journey south led them into a fierce battle against a formidable stone golem, where Grulk's thunderous strikes and Xadira's precise archery ultimately dismantled the construct. Navigating through mystical portals, the group faced personal visions and celestial trials that tested their inner strengths and unity, culminating in a confrontation with cultists guarding a magical orb. After cleansing the orb and accepting Pim’s newfound role as a celestial champion, they returned to the material plane, gathered rare herbs, and secured a hefty reward at a lively tavern, albeit with some humorous magical side effects from a questionable ale. As they regroup and recover, the party remains steadfast in their mission to dismantle the curse and confront the looming threats surrounding their journey.

## In Reality Notes 

We step out of tavern- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Xadira\|Xadira]] sees a hooded figure on one of the rooftops.
The figure nods at Xadira and moves away.

We make our way to a dark alley as not to scare anyone.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] takes the astrolobe and notices that the metal parts are starting to melt.

Pim, takes the globe and concentrates on somewhere near where we wanted to be.
As we reapear [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]] Pim and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Xadira\|Xadira]] throw there guts up.  

We get our barings.

As we stand talking, an owlbear comes out of the woods.
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eldrin Greenwalker\|Eldrin Greenwalker]] talks to it.
	- At least he is making more sense than he normally does grunting as a bear.
	- The owlbear warns us of some wolves in the woods.

We enter the woods.

The woods are eery and unnatural.
The trees are twisted.
A low mist covers the floor.
The wood feels like it is watching us.
Faint whispers.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]] finds some glowing mushrooms.
- Goes to pick some.
- The mushrooms explodes in a ball of fire.
- Not learning his lesson, he tries to pick another one.
	- Luckily he succeeds

We move on.

Xaderia leads the way as she is a ranger and at home in forests.

We come to an archway
- Covered in runes and a recess for a hand.
	- The runes say along the lines of "we will heal the sick" etc.
	- The hand print glows.
	- Everyone stays Still. 
	- Grulk, bored with this already puts his hand in the recess.
	- A portal opens.
		- Once again Grulk takes decisive action
	- We step through.

Peaceful glade.
A path leads towards a wood.
We follow the path.
We hear whispers.
- Can't make out what is being said

The others, except [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Grulk Frostblood\|Grulk Frostblood]], hear someone saying that we will fail our mission.  And they start to become unnerved and fearful.

End of session.


# Grulk's Saga: A Tale of Honour and Valour

**Aye, let me tell ye what *truly* happened in Grulk's words—none of that dull recountin’ with pathetic one-syllable grunts like some weak-kneed elf! Prepare yourself, ‘cause here comes the tale as only *Grulk* can tell it—drenched in *honour*, *valour*, and a heavy dose of well-deserved praise for ME. Now listen close, because this is a saga that'll put frost in yer bones and fire in yer heart!**

## A Night at the Tavern

Where does every great adventure begin, ye ask? Well, let me tell ye—it's always with trouble brewin' and a tavern in the mix. The tavern was a rowdy place, filled with the smell of stale ale, roasted meat, and the kind of sweat that comes from a hard day’s adventuring. Patrons of all kinds gathered there—burly mercenaries, cloaked figures whisperin' secrets, and drunkards shoutin' at the tops of their lungs. The air was thick with laughter, arguments, and the occasional crash of a chair. It was just the kind of place where trouble could be found, and we were lookin' for it. We were stumblin' out of that raucous joint, bellies full of booze and heads full of bravado. The lot of us drinkin’ enough to drown a White dragon—and by the way, dragons are all cowards! Remind me someday to regale you with the long, *glorious* [[Kingdom of Zemland/5. Lore/History/Grulks Tale - The history of the war between Dragons and Giants\|history between Giants and Dragons]], and how they cheat in every way imaginable. The dragons fear true strength, and their cunning knows no end.

## The Mysterious Figure and the Dark Alley

Anyway, Xadira, she of the ever-watchful eyes (good fer somethin’ at least), was the first to spot some shady figure standin’ up there on the rooftops like a sneak. The figure nods at her and walks off like there's some secret we don't know about. Makes ya wonder, eh? Kax, always thinkin' with his other brain, wants us to head into a dark alley. Naturally, we followed—dark alleys mean danger, and danger means fun! So there we went, marchin’ into trouble with grins on our faces.

## The Unreliable Magic and the Strange Forest

And what do we find there? Well, Workax, that magic-wielding fool, whips out his shiny astrolabe—at least, that’s what he calls it. Personally, I think it's a load of nonsense. Anyway, it starts lookin' like it’s meltin’ faster than a snowflake tossed into a dragon's breath. Magic—always unreliable, always dramatic. Lucky for us, Pim’s got a bit of a head on his shoulders and concentrated hard enough to get us *somewhere*. Poof, and there we were, dropped into some mysterious spot without any warnin’. The place was dark, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and something metallic—like blood. Trees loomed around us, their branches twisted like skeletal fingers reaching out to grab us. The ground was covered in a thick layer of mist, and every breath felt heavy, as if the forest itself was tryin’ to keep us there. Strange sounds echoed in the distance—unearthly howls and rustling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It was the kinda place that made lesser folks turn tail and run, but to *Grulk*, it was just another challenge. Who needs fancy teleportin’? Not Grulk! I'd rather walk through storms and mountains, but it did the trick.

## Encounter with the Owlbear

Just as we're gettin' our bearings, outta nowhere, an owlbear stumbles outta the woods—ugly beast with feathers and fury. Eldrin steps forward, all animal-like and grunty, and what do ya know? The bloody thing *understands* him! Aye, Eldrin speaks its language, and apparently, there are wolves up ahead. Do we shy away? Of course not! Grulk don't take warnings from overgrown birds, not when there's glory to be had. So off we went, into the woods, marchin’ head-on toward whatever was out there.

## The Twisted Woods and Exploding Mushrooms

Now let me tell ya, this forest was somethin' straight outta a nightmare—all twisted trees and twisted voices. Mist hangin' in the air like a blanket, stickin’ to our skin and seepin’ into our bones, cold as death itself. The branches creaked above us, sway'n as if they were whisperin' secrets, and shadows moved like spectres just beyond our vision. Every now and then, there’d be a rustlin' sound—like something movin' just outta sight, makin' the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It felt like the whole forest was watchin' us, waitin' for us to make one wrong step. The branches above looked like crooked, gnarled fingers, all twisted in agony, stretchin' toward us. It was like the whole forest wanted us dead. And what does Wentri do? He starts fiddlin’ with some glowin’ mushrooms! The fool picks one up, and it *explodes*! Flame, smoke, the whole lot. Any other druid might learn a lesson, but not Wentri. He reaches for another one, and—somehow—succeeds! I swear, that lad’s one mushroom away from his own funeral.

## The Glowing Archway and the Portal to the Glade

We pressed on through the creepy woods, and wouldn’t ya know it, we came across this glowing archway—covered in fancy runes, all bright and mystic-like. There was a place for a hand, and while the others stood there lookin' puzzled, scratchin' their heads, I, *Grulk*, stepped forward and did what had to be done. No hesitation, just action. I jammed my hand right in there—BOOM! The portal opened! Sometimes, all ya need is guts, and I got plenty. Through the portal we went, into a peaceful-lookin' glade. Whispers in the air, trees all gentle—didn't bother me none, but the others, they were twitchy. Always worried about what the whispers might mean. Unless those whispers are about how *great* I am, they can keep 'em.

## The Treacherous River Crossing

Then we reached a river—a roarin', frothy mess, like a thousand angry giants hollerin' all at once. Xadira, showin’ off with her manta ray cloak, jumped in to swim across, but that current? Stronger than her, no doubt. It pulled her under. And guess who saved her? *Grulk*, of course! One massive leap, and there I was, crossin' the river like it was a puddle. No fuss, no drama. The others struggled, even Wentri with his floatin' nonsense—lookin' like some sort of owlbear Moses partin’ the water. Hah! But they all made it, thanks to *me*. They’d be lost without Grulk, I tell ya.

## Confronting Illusions and Nightmares

And then it all went to chaos. Suddenly, we were each on our own, facin' our worst nightmares. Me? I saw a fire-giant—mighty and terrible, skin aglow like the forge, eyes blazin'. And what did I do? I charged, of course! Roarin' my war-cry, axe lifted high! But every step I took, the giant seemed to pull away, like a coward. My roar echoed, shakin' the ground beneath me, but it was like fightin' smoke, the giant never gettin' closer. Next thing I knew, Workax was there, shakin' me out of the illusion. Turns out, the others were trapped too—Pim? Oh, Pim was curled up, shiverin' like a terrified rabbit. Needed a good smack to come back to reality. That's just Pim for ya.

## The Stone Golems and the Crumbling Bridge

We kept on movin’ and eventually came to a bridge guarded by two massive stone golems, standin' there like ancient sentinels, demandin' some kind of tribute or payment. Useless, the lot of them—I offered up Workax first, thinkin' maybe a wizard might interest 'em, but even the golems knew better! Big rock-heads weren't that stupid, apparently. I even tried to give them *Wentri*, figured they'd take a druid as a gift, but nope. No deal. They just stood there, silent and menacing. The bridge itself was crumblin', with ancient stones ready to collapse at the slightest touch. Moss covered everything, and the air was thick with the smell of damp rock and old magic. And poor Wentri—he tried to cross the bridge multiple times. Every time he stepped forward, a stone would give way, and he'd fall through, limbs flailing like some kinda ridiculous ragdoll. He climbed back up, tried again, and down he went—over and over, until even the golems looked like they were tryin' not to laugh. Naturally, a fight broke out—how else could it end with *Grulk* around? I roared my battle cry, and the clash of stone and steel filled the air. I destroyed one of those golems—crushed it to rubble with my axe, each swing echoing like thunder—while Workax used his big magic hand to push the other one off the bridge. It went tumblin' down, shatterin' into pieces below. But don't be fooled—I had weakened it first, made sure it was ready for the final shove. No stone golem is a match for *Grulk’s* axe, and no obstacle stands in the way of *Grulk Frostblood*! That bridge didn’t know what hit it, and neither did those golems. The others just watched in awe, like they always do when *Grulk* is in action. Aye, I tell ya, nothin' feels better than the crunch of stone under my swing, knowin' I'm clearin' the path for the lot of 'em!

## Scaling the Mountain

The path ahead led us up a mountainside. Let me tell ya—this climb was no joke. The gravel was loose underfoot, sliding away at the slightest touch, and sharp stones cut into our hands every time we grabbed hold. It was a steep, near-vertical ascent that seemed to stretch endlessly above us, disappearing into the clouds like some impossible wall meant to keep us out. Everyone else was slippin’, fallin’, strugglin' like fish outta water, clawin' at the rocks as if they’d grow wings. Xadira cursed under her breath, Pim tried to find footing with a monk’s grace, but even he was havin' trouble. Wentri? Hah! Wentri was more on his backside than his feet, slippin' every time he took a step. And there was Grulk—*me*—lifting boulders, pullin' these weaklings up one by one, haulin' ‘em like sacks of potatoes. Every time they fell, there I was, yankin’ 'em back up. While they shivered and whined about the cold, I felt *alive*! The air was crisp, icy, invigoration runnin' through me like a surge of pure power. Reminded me of the Wintermaw, of home, where every breath feels like strength pourin' into yer lungs, where the chill is like a challenge. Without me, they'd have been buried under a mountain of fallen rocks, lost to the cold and crushed under the weight of their own weakness. Wimps! And ya know what? There were moments when we had to cross narrow ledges, the wind howlin' like a banshee, tryin' to shove us off. I went first, of course, makin' sure it was safe for the rest. I braced myself against the wind, every gust tryin’ to knock me down, but it was nothin' compared to the blizzards of the north. I set ropes, pounded pitons into the rock, and helped the others across one by one. They clung to the ropes, teeth chatterin', faces pale. Meanwhile, Grulk was enjoyin' the view! The mountains stretchin' below us, valleys covered in frost, peaks that looked like the backs of slumberin' titans. And when we finally reached the top? It felt like conquerin' a mighty beast. There we stood, pantin' and shiverin'—everyone else on their knees, gaspin' for breath. But not me. No, I stood tall, lookin' out over the path we’d conquered, knowin' that no mountain, no cold, no height could ever beat *Grulk Frostblood*. It was a climb to remember, and while the others might have cursed every step, to me, it was just another glorious day.

## The Shrine and the Test of Mercy

Then we stumbled upon yet another portal and, bein’ the brave souls we are, stepped through. This time, we found ourselves in a wide valley, surrounded by towering cliffs, with a shrine at its center. The air was thick with the scent of old incense, and the faint echo of distant chanting seemed to vibrate from the stones themselves. The test here? Mercy. Mercy, bah! Leave that soft-hearted drivel to someone else. There was this pilgrim—half-dead, groanin' on the ground, lookin' all pitiful. Pim, bless his fragile little heart, rushed over to help the poor sod. While Pim was busy helpin' that pitiful pilgrim, I decided to take a nap. Not much else to do when it's all about 'mercy' and 'kindness.' The shrine was filled with carvings of monks prayin', words about compassion and forgiveness—nothin' but wasted effort if ya ask me. Statues lined the walls, all robed figures with their hands folded like they were beggin' for somethin'. I even saw a fountain in the back, water flowin' from the mouth of some stone lion, tryin' to make the place look all serene. None of that nonsense means a thing to Grulk. Still, Pim seemed pleased enough with himself after bandagin' up the pilgrim and makin' sure he was comfortable. He even tried to recite some words of comfort—soft stuff that'd put anyone to sleep. But hey, Pim was proud, so I let him have his moment. I reckon the others were all watchin' in silence, tryin' to feel somethin' deep. Me? I just waited for the next real challenge, somethin' worthy of *Grulk Frostblood*.

## The Starving Village and Wentri's Generosity

Eventually, we came to a village—full of skinny, wide-eyed folk lookin' like they’d never seen a proper meal in their lives. Wentri, always tryin' to be the hero, conjured up some food, and the villagers worshipped him like some kinda god. They even gave him a potion. Meanwhile, I knew it was *my* axe that was truly keepin' 'em safe—without Grulk, Wentri's food would mean nothin'. Still, let him have his fan club, if it makes him feel better.

## Echion's Redemption

Further along the path, some twisted beast appeared—a friend of Pim’s, Echion, lost to corruption. Pim went ahead and cleansed him—lots of cryin’, lots of bondin’. Bah, I nearly dozed off again. But after all that nonsense, we felt some kinda blessin’ wash over us. Nothin' new for Grulk—I’m always blessed by the frost gods. The creature thanked Pim, all teary-eyed and grateful, and then disappeared. At least we were on the move again, finally.

## Battles with Seraphina and Vaen Silversong

And then came Seraphina Shadow-somethin'—cloak all dark, voice all mysterious, full of threats, like she thought she could scare *Grulk* and his crew. She came at us with dark magic and words like daggers, but let me tell ya, her words were nothin' but hot air to me. We fought, and like the coward she was, she fled after takin’ a few hits. She tried to throw shadows and curses, but my axe cut through 'em like butter. Not long after, Vaen Silversong thought she'd have a go—her eyes filled with pure hatred, strikin’ at us with all the rage she could muster. She had blades flashin', spells sparkin', and her fury was somethin' to behold, but she too was sent runnin’ in the end. I’ll admit, she put up a better fight than Seraphina, but it still wasn’t enough. We were an unstoppable force, and she realized that all too late. So much bluster from these so-called villains, but no real fight in 'em when it came to facin' *Grulk Frostblood*. Victory, as always, was ours—thanks mainly to *Grulk*. They all come at us with their threats, their curses, and their empty bravado, but they all leave in pieces, their courage shattered like glass against the might of the Wintermaw. I swear, they never learn. If they come at *Grulk*, they better bring more than empty threats and weak magic. They better be ready to face a storm of fury, ‘cause I don’t leave till my enemies are on their knees.

## Resting by the Fire

We found a place to rest after that—a cosy little room with cushions and warmth. The cushions were deep red, scattered across the floor and piled on low wooden benches, with a worn rug spread out in front of a crackling fireplace. The warmth from the fire filled the room, and the flickering light cast dancing shadows on the stone walls. The others collapsed, sighin' like they’d fought a horde of frost trolls. Me? I was just gettin' started, ready to take on a dragon or two if they showed up. But I let 'em rest, 'cause they needed it more than I did. I wandered around the room, pokin' at the cushions and lookin' out a small window that gave us a view of the moonlit forest beyond. The room was quiet, warm, with a fireplace cracklin' in the corner. I could hear the others breathin', deep and exhausted, their snores echoing softly. I might've even grabbed a cushion and done a few bicep curls, just to keep myself from gettin' too bored. After what felt like forever (probably just an hour or two, but ya know), they finally stirred, lookin' a bit less pathetic.

## Solving the Riddle of the Pedestals

After that, we found ourselves facin’ a room with pedestals and a riddle—naturally, they all floundered about, strugglin’ to make sense of it. Pim was tryin' to read the inscriptions, Eldrin mutterin' about some ancient symbols, Wentri starin' like he could will the answer to come to him. But not *Grulk*! Aye, *Grulk the Genius* stepped up, saw through the nonsense, and figured it out. It was all about placin' the objects in the right order—simple when you've got a brain as sharp as mine. I solved it, opened the door, and the look on their faces was priceless. They all stared, mouths open, and I just shrugged. What can I say? Brains, brawn, and sheer excellence—that’s Grulk. I swear, these lot would be lost without me!

## Confrontation with the High Abbot

We came upon a floating chalice, and Pim made the mistake of reachin' for it. The shadows weren't havin’ it. A high abbot appeared, all ethereal, shoutin' that Pim wasn’t worthy. Big words for a ghost. Looks like we’ve got another fight brewin’, and that’s just how I like it. I’ve got an axe ready with this abbot’s name on it, and he’ll soon learn why they call me *Grulk Frostblood*, the unstoppable force of the Wintermaw!
