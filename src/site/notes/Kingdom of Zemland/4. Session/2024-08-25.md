- This seems to be an ongoing theme of this place.
	- Wisdom
	- Strength. 
	- Honour.
	- Loyalty. 
	- Fire. 
	- Air.

During the rest of the search  we find a scroll and a book.
- When wisdom leads, strength follows. (wisdom/strength). 
- The air carries the whispers of magic. (air/Magic).
- But it is the fire that fuels spirit (fire/Loyalty(Honour?).
- It the loyalty, honour resides.
- Without honour, loyalty is but an empty something, blah, blah, blah.

	- Think I may need to sign him up to the guild, taking all the good stuff.

We leave the library.  we come to a large obsidian double door.

As we enter the room the doors close behind us.
- Shock Horror.

An obsidian dragon steps out of one of the pools.
- Kax goes to talk to it.

The dragon talks to kax.
Kax wishes to take the oath to become a dragon knight.

The Dragon asks if the others wish to join him in a task.
