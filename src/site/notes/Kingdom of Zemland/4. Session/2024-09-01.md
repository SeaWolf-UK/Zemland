Going forward these notes will be made by [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Grulk Frostblood\|Grulk Frostblood]] - gods help us all.


Here's Grulk's version of the above....................

Ah, sit yer arse down and let Grulk tell ya what really happened. So, we start outside some puny fort, and Seraphina starts jabberin' in everyone's heads, linking up with Pim, Wentri, and Workax. Like talkin' ain't enough, now we gotta hear voices too. She turns into some sneaky shadow creature and slinks into the fort's courtyard, sees no guards, which is weird, then spots some lass getting dragged off, screaming like a stuck pig.

So, what does Seraphina do? She sneaks in further like some rat. Finds a ceremony—great. One of them cult things. She whispers in everyone’s head about it, and we’re all supposed to be impressed.

Then the fight kicks off. Kax throws some weird magic void stuff at the sacrifice to yank her back. Seraphina, always with the drama, throws a psychic blade at the dragonborn leading the freak show. Turns out it's Ella, and she's summoning some massive tentacle beast through a portal. Yeah, ‘cause that’s what we need—more godsdamned tentacles.

Seraphina, being all noble-like, goes to talk to her mum. Real heartfelt moment, yeah? But the big bad squid monster’s about to rip everyone to shreds. So, Seraphina pulls out her "oh-shit" plan. She tells everyone through the link to leg it and that it's been a pleasure or some sentimental crap. Pim’s busy fighting, so she telekinetically yeets him out of harm's way. Then she shoves one bag of holding into another and—BOOM!—black hole. Sucks up Ella, the monster, and Seraphina herself. Gone. Poof. Sent to the Astral Plane. Good riddance, eh?

Kax reads Seraphina’s stupid farewell letter while the rest of us start digging through the basement. Turns out the tentacle monster was a pet of Tiamat. Figures. We find some gold, a dried heart, and a finger. I ain't askin' where that came from.

There’s a locked chest, and we can’t be bothered to figure it out, so we smash it open. Inside? A ribcage. Tabaxi bones. Lovely.

We check some barrels. One’s full of dragon blood, another with whiskey. Guess which one I’m interested in.

Pim chats up the lass, Delia, from Willow Gate. Xadira also gets involved, findin' out she was held by hooded freaks and fed table scraps. Real cozy.

Then we find a couple cultists outside. Kax tries to be scary, asks 'em questions, but they don’t know much. They’re with Tiamat and think they’re savin’ the world by helpin’ Drakor come back. Turns out we might've had it all wrong—Harbingers of the Void are the real baddies. Ella was second-in-command, but the head honcho is some bloke named Dave. Yeah, Dave. What the hell?

After that, we head to Delia's village to drop her off. Xadira finally spills that the amulet she's been lugging around is cursed. Big surprise there. Apparently, it’s fusing with her. She dreams about some battle between Drakor and Zemroy, sees familiar faces from the group, maybe even some future nonsense. Who cares? It’s all jibber-jabber.

We take Delia to her dad, Tarnan. He’s all grateful, offers free food and drinks at the local tavern. Now we’re talkin'. We hit the tavern, Eldar Tree Sanctuary, and guess who shows up? _Me,_ the mighty Grulk Frostblood. I drink the whole lot of ‘em under the table, no contest.

I offer to join the group if they help me get revenge on the Fire Giants that slaughtered my kin. Yeah, that’s right—_I’m_ a Frost Giant. Got a problem with that?

We head to another tavern, The Bald Eagle, split some profits, then go see a lady about the cursed amulet. Xadira wants answers, but the lady says the amulet’s dangerous, and Xadira’s probably gonna start craving weird meat and growing scales. Oh, and previous wearers died. Great news, right?

She gives us a book in celestial. No one speaks it, of course, except _me_. Yeah, Grulk’s cleverer than all you puny fools. The book says we need a Wish spell, sage (either the plant or a smartass, we dunno), and an exorcism to remove the curse. Sounds simple, right?

The lady gets bored of us and teleports us 42 miles away, smack in the middle of the Whispering Woods. No horse, no cart—just walkin’.

On the way back to Dragon Tail, Xadira starts eatin' a raw lizard. Told ya the weird meat thing kicked in. We hit up the Mage’s Guild, they cast Greater Restoration, and the curse is "sort of" broken. The amulet drops off, but we gotta keep an eye on Xadira for a few weeks.

Then we decide to head to the mountains to take on the Fire Giants. Now we’re talkin'—time to smash some skulls. But Xadira’s gettin’ more visions. I’m already sick of ‘em.

Before we even reach the mountains, a dragonborn jumps out and attacks us.

End of session. Next time, it’s all gonna be written by _me_, so prepare yourself, ‘cause it’s gonna get real.
