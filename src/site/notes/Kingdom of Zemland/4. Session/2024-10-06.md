## Session 32

#### Roll Call

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] - Half-Elf Sorcerer
[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]] - Gnome Druid
[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Grulk Frostblood\|Grulk Frostblood]] - [[Kingdom of Zemland/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin\|goblin]] Barbarian

## Recap
In the last session, the party continued their adventures while still inside the Rune Chamber, reflecting on the events that transpired in Crustward. As they explored the room, Kax inadvertently fused a cursed mask to his face, prompting the group to seek a way to remove it. An attempt to break the mask triggered a chaotic collapse of the chamber, forcing a desperate escape. After a pie-induced nightmare filled with haunting visions, the party found themselves confronting monks at Pim's monastery, who were embroiled in dark rituals. Tensions escalated when the monks tried to corrupt Pim, leading to Grulk unleashing his fury, cleaving one in two. Despite their efforts to retrieve the mask fragments, the party ultimately left the monastery, their mission far from over.

## Grulk's Version


### **Session 32: The Full Glory and Fury of Grulk Frostblood**

---

### **Roll Call of the Fools:**

- **Workax Dreyman** - Half-Elf Sorcerer. More brain than brawn, but finally seems to be growin' a backbone.
- **Wentri Sporesnore** - Gnome Druid. Plant-lover and frequent face-planter, but he’s got his uses… sometimes.
- **Grulk Frostblood** - The true might of the Wintermaw Clan. Giant in spirit, goblin by form, and the only reason this lot hasn’t died a hundred times over.
- **Eldrin Greenwalker** - Elf Druid. Always turnin’ into animals. Helps out here and there, though his bear form could use some work.
- **Xadira** - Human Ranger. Quick with a bow and steady in battle. A warrior who knows when to take the shot.
- **Pim** - Halfling Monk. Full of regret and doubts, but he’s startin’ to see the light. Maybe.

---

### **On the Path to Wolf Fort (Where a Goose Tests Grulk's Patience)**

After escapin' the cursed Rune Chamber, we sat around, discussin' our next move. As the group yammered on, **Grulk** made the decision: we’d head towards **Wolf Fort** to retrieve one of the sacred artifacts. No more delayin’—the **blood of giants** called to me.

As we trudged along the road, we came across somethin'... unusual. There it stood in the middle of the path, a **goose**, wearin’ a **wizard’s hat**. A **talkin' goose** no less. I narrowed me eyes, fingers itchin' to grab me axe.

It starts squawkin' and **offered to teach us spells**. Ridiculous. Then it tried castin' spells at us—useless **tricks** that did nothin' but annoy **Grulk**. The final straw was when the bird conjured up a **feather duster**. 

“**That's it!**” I snarled, **turnin' on me heel** to leave, but the blasted goose cast another spell. This time, it **conjured an egg over me head**. It cracked open, and I stood there, **yolk drippin’ down** me face. **Grulk’s blood boiled**.

I turned to the bird, **axe raised high**. “**Ye’ve chosen yer fate, bird! Time to pluck yer feathers!**” I roared, and the others knew better than to get in me way. 

But of course, **Eldrin** stepped in, spreadin' his arms between me and the goose. “**Grulk, wait!**” he pleaded. I glared at him, me muscles twitchin' with the need to **crush the feathered pest**.

"**Move, druid, or I’ll go through ye,**” I growled. But **Eldrin** held firm, and the goose, clearly frightened, **produced a spellbook** and handed it to **Wentri**.

“**Ye got lucky, goose,**” I grumbled, turnin' away. "Not worth me time." We left it behind and used our magic to **teleport to Wolf Fort**, where a real challenge awaited.

---

### **Arrival at Wolf Fort (Where Grulk Shows His Power)**

The teleport dropped us into the heart of **Wolf Fort**, close enough to the **mountains**—the same ones that hide the **Fire Giants** who attacked me clan. I could feel me heart poundin' with the need for revenge. But first, we were surrounded by **guards**, weapons drawn and ready to strike.

"**MOVE, OR FACE GRULK’S WRATH!**" I bellowed, liftin’ me axe high, teeth bared like a wild beast. They hesitated, glancin’ at each other, fear in their eyes.

Then I played the trump card: “**THIS HERE IS WORKAX DREYMAN, A DRAGON KNIGHT!**” The guards’ faces went pale as snow in winter. They **dropped their weapons** and **groveled** before **Kax**, as they should.

We were led into the fort, with the guards fallin' over themselves to show **Kax** to the **captain's quarters**, all posh-like with a soft feather bed and silver goblets. Bah! Soft livin' makes ye weak. Me and the others went to the **barracks**, which suited **Grulk** just fine. **Real warriors** need nothin' but a hard floor and a roof over their heads.

---

### **Feast of Heroes (Where Grulk Fills His Belly and Watches the Fools)**

Now, if there’s one thing I’ll admit to likin' in this fort, it's the **feast**. They brought out plates piled high with **roast meats, breads, cheeses**, and ale by the barrel. This was a proper **heroes' feast**, and I dug in without a second thought.

As I filled me belly, the fools started messin' around with the **goose’s spellbook**. **Eldrin** tried to cast somethin’, wavin' his hands and mutterin'. Next thing we know, **Wentri** bursts into laughter, nearly fallin' off his seat. 

Then **Wentri** had his go, but whatever he was tryin', it failed miserably. “**Yer wastin' yer time,**” I grunted between mouthfuls of mutton. 

---

### **The Journey to the Golem's Gate (Where Grulk Smashes Stone)**

Next mornin', we set out to the south, headin' towards where the artifact was rumored to be. The terrain grew thick with **overgrowth**, slowin' our pace and takin' hours to navigate. 

Then we heard it: a **grindin’ noise**, like **stone on stone**. We pressed on, eventually comin' to an **archway**, and there it stood—**a Stone Golem**. Its eyes glowed, and it moved toward us, each step causin' the ground to tremble.

"**FINALLY, A WORTHY FOE!**" I roared, lettin’ the **rage** swell up inside me. My muscles **bulged**, growin' to my full **twelve-foot height**. The **others** prepared themselves, but they knew this was **Grulk's** battle.

**Eldrin** turned into a bear and charged, **swipin’** at the golem with his claws. The hit landed, but the golem’s stone hide barely took a scratch.

“**Weak, bear!**” I shouted. The golem responded by **raisins' the ground** beneath us, **liftin' me** and the bear into the air. Then it swung a massive arm, slammin' into **Wentri** and knockin’ him out of his wildshape. The druid crashed to the ground, groanin' in pain.

"**GRULK'S TURN!**" I bellowed, swingin' me **thunder-charged axe**. The first hit struck the golem’s chest, **crackin' its stone armor** and sendin' **shards flyin'**. The second hit landed square on its shoulder, and a **massive chunk broke away**, tumblin’ to the earth.

**Xadira** was right behind me, **hunter’s mark** glowin’ on the golem as she loosed two arrows. Both struck true, chippin' away more of the golem’s defenses.

**Kax**, showin' his usefulness for once, raised a hand and **commanded** the golem to halt. To my surprise, the damn thing **listened**, its arms droppin' to its sides.

**Pim** dashed forward, **healin’ Eldrin** before layin' into the golem with a flurry of punches. It was pitiful; the golem barely flinched at his strikes.

“**Is that the best ye can do?**” I scoffed, already gearin’ up for me next attack. **Grulk** swung me axe again, **splinterin' the golem’s arm** clean off with the force of the blow.

**Xadira**, ever the marksman, lined up one final shot. Her arrow flew straight and true, buryin' itself in the golem's forehead. With a **shudder**, the stone beast crumbled to pieces, its magic finally undone.

"**Nice shot, Xadira,**" I grunted, grudgingly givin' her the praise she deserved.

---

### **The Portal of Trials (Where Grulk Faces Shadows of the Past)**

After searchin’ the rubble and findin' nothin', **Pim** read the runes on the archway, openin' a **portal**. We stepped through to a field of **golden grass**, the air still and unnervingly calm.

This calmness didn’t sit right with **Grulk**. A warrior thrives in chaos and battle, not peace. As we walked the path, I kept me axe in hand, eyes shiftin' for any sign of a trap.

The path led us to a **cathedral**, silent and seemingly abandoned. Inside, **Pim** went to a statue that trickled water

 from its hands, offerin' his **goodberry** to a wounded deer. The beast drank, and a portal opened.

---

### **The Celestial Riddles and Trials (Where Grulk Faces Fire Giants)**

Through the portal, we found a **celestial being** awaitin' us. It asked a series of **riddles**, which the group answered one by one. I crossed me arms, grumblin', not interested in word games.

Then the celestial raised its hand, and a **vision** engulfed each of us. **Grulk** saw the **Fire Giants**, their molten eyes gleamin’ as they **slaughtered me clan**. The scene twisted, tryin' to fill me with **isolation and fear**, but I **knew it was false**. I survived, and I would have me revenge. I snapped free of the vision’s grip, standin' tall while the others crumbled.

**Eldrin** lay sobbin' on the ground, lost in his bear form. **Wentri** fell to his knees, relivin' some past failure. **Pim** struggled but managed to break through his own doubts, gainin' some semblance of strength.

---

### **The Final Trial (Where Grulk Sees Through Lies)**

We pressed on, steppin' through yet another portal. This time, we stood in a **dyin' landscape**, rot and decay everywhere. In front of us loomed a **cave** where **chantin' echoed**.

Inside, we found **four cultists** around an altar, faces twisted into that of **Pim** and others. I marched up, ready to smash the orb they chanted around.

"**DON'T TOUCH IT!**" they screamed, their voices piercin' the air. I stopped, but not outta fear—outta **boredom**. 

"Pim," I growled, "do somethin' useful." To his credit, the monk stepped forward, attemptin' a **ritual** to cleanse the orb. The light within it brightened, and the chanters screamed before vanishin' into thin air. 

A celestial appeared, spoutin' more nonsense. It offered **Pim** the chance to be its champion. After a lot of talk, he **agreed**.

"Great," I muttered, "we’ve got a therapist monk now."

---

### **The Aftermath (Where Grulk Finds the Ale Lacking)**

Back in the real world, we spent some time **gatherin' herbs**, then **teleported outside Dragontail**. As soon as we arrived, **Wentri** promptly **puked** all over the ground. Weak stomachs, the lot of 'em.

We made our way to the **tavern**, which was **packed** with folks. The firbolg barkeep led us to a back room, handin' us a hefty pouch filled with **1476 gold pieces**. A good haul, but it still couldn't fill the emptiness where battle belonged.

Kax asked about trustworthy regulars and whether anyone was spyin’ on us. We then tried a new ale, with options for **berry** or **no berry**. I downed me mug in one go, but it did nothin’ but make **berries sprout on me skin**. 

---

### **Grulk’s Hunger for More** 

Sittin’ there, feelin' the berries growin' on me skin, I grunted in disgust. This ale was **garbage**—not somethin' worthy of a true warrior. I needed **fire and steel**, not this magic trickery.

But the journey ain't over. **Grulk Frostblood** will find those Fire Giants, reclaim me honor, and show this world what true power is.

**End of Session.**
