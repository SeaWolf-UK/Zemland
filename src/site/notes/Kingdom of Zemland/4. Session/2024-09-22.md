## Session 30

#### Roll Call

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]]
[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]]
[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Grulk Frostblood\|Grulk Frostblood]]


## Recap

In the last session, the party faced several challenges, starting with traversing a shimmering door that spat Pim back into the corridor, but Grulk's sharp eye quickly found a doorknob that allowed the party to pass. The group then ventured into a room filled with unnatural darkness, where Grulk, after a brief collision with a pillar, stood ready as Wentri dispelled the magic. Hearing voices from a grate, the group realized Pim’s old mentors awaited them. A tense battle followed, with Grulk delivering mighty blows, ultimately saving the group once again. Afterward, the party encountered a cursed lotus, which they eventually burned after dealing with a shadow beast. The session ended with a descent into a quarry, a mysterious rune chamber, and Pim’s unsettling dream, setting the stage for more danger ahead.

## In Reality

A side quest.

As we spend the night in the Rune chamber, we tell some tails of our time in Dragon Tail.

We travel back in time, to when we were still in Dragontail.

We sit in the adventures guild looking at job board whilst [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Xadira\|Xadira]], [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Pim\|Pim]] and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eldrin Greenwalker\|Eldrin Greenwalker]] are away doing other things.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Wentri Sporesnore\|Wentri Sporesnore]] checks the room and gets attacked by a pastry golem.

- It carries on.

End of session.

### **Session 30: The Mighty Pie Caper of Grulk Frostblood**

---

### **The Party of Fools:**

- **Kax Dreyman**—the sorcerer, always wavin' his hands and mutterin' fancy words to cast spells. He’s smart, aye, but weak as a snowflake, always needin’ **Grulk’s protection**.
- **Wentri Sporesnore**—the druid obsessed with mushrooms and vines. He’s handy with his magic, but more interested in plants than battle. Still, useful enough to keep around.
- And then there’s **me—Grulk Frostblood**. The **mighty warrior** of the Wintermaw Clan, with the heart of a **Frost Giant**, and the only reason these fools are still alive. When I rage, I grow to **12 feet tall**, towerin’ over the battlefield, and **me massive axe**, normally draggin' behind me, becomes like a **hand axe** in me mighty grip.

---

### **The Start of the Pie Caper (Where Grulk Gets Bored)**

We sat in the **Adventurer’s Guild** at **Dragontail**, bored outta our skulls while **Xadira**, **Pim**, and **Eldrin** were off doin’ gods-know-what. **Grulk** was itch in' for battle, but all we had were some measly jobs on the board.

- **Operation Chicken Heist**: Some village lost their **golden egg-layin’ chicken**. Bah, who cares about chickens?
    
- **The Pie Caper**: A village called **Crustward** kept losin’ their **festival pie** to bandits. A mystery to solve, they said, but **Grulk don’t solve mysteries**—he solves problems with his axe.
    

“**We’re takin’ the pie job,**” I declared, slammin’ me fist on the table. The others agreed, and we set off for **Crustward**, ready to split some heads and bring back a damn pie.

---

### **Crustward: Land of Fools and Traps (Where Grulk’s Patience Wears Thin)**

When we reached **Crustward**, the place was decked out for their **festival**—**bunting everywhere**, like they had somethin’ to celebrate. But there was **no pie** in sight, and the villagers were runnin’ around like chickens with their heads cut off.

Some fool came up to us, panicked, askin’ if we’d seen any **bandits carryin' a big pie**.

“**Shut yer mouth!**” I growled, pushin’ him aside. **Grulk don’t need fools whinin’.**

The **village mayor** promised us **600 gold** if we got the pie back and **even more** if we stopped the yearly nonsense. As soon as he turned to leave—**BOOM**—he **steps on a trap** and gets launched into the air, landin' **dead as a rock**.

I nearly **died laughin’**, but that wasn’t the end of it. As we went back to the village, we set off **more traps**. **Grulk** was ready to lose it. **Who in the hells sets traps in their own village?**

---

### **The New Mayor (Where Grulk Takes Charge)**

With the old mayor now a **splattered mess**, they appointed a **new mayor**, but she wasn’t much smarter. Turns out, they knew about the **traps** but didn’t know who set ‘em.

**Grulk’s patience was gone** by this point. I grabbed the new mayor by the collar, lifted her off the ground, and **convinced** her to send the **villagers out** to clear the path.

She sent **20 villagers**. **Three came back**.

“**Oh well,**” I muttered, not carin’ much. They were weak anyway.

---

### **The Fort of Fools: Grulk’s Rage Unleashed**

After an hour’s walk, we found the bandits’ **small fort**, and wouldn’t ye know it—they were **throwin’ pies** at us from the walls. **That was it.**

I felt the **rage boilin’ up** inside me, and before I knew it, **Grulk grew**—**me 3-foot goblin frame** stretchin' to a **12-foot behemoth**, muscles ripplin’, me eyes burnin' with fury. Me **massive axe**, normally draggin' behind me, was now like a **hand axe** in me grip.

I charged forward, **smashin’ through the fort’s door** with **one blow**, wood splinterin’ everywhere. Inside the **courtyard**, two bandits stood frozen in fear.

I split the first bandit in **two** with a single swing, his **insides spillin’ out** all over the courtyard. The second bandit tried to run, but I **hacked him to pieces**, his blood sprayin' the walls.

---

### **The Doughball Attack (Where Grulk Feeds the Flames)**

Just when we thought it was over, the door **burst open**, and out rolled **animated doughballs**—aye, **balls o’ dough**, ready to fight.

I couldn’t believe it, but they were real enough. The **doughballs charged**, and **Wentri Sporesnore**—poor lad—got **blinded by a custard pie**, right in the face. Then another **jam pie** hit him, and he was stumblin' around, blind as a bat.

**Grulk** didn’t have time for this nonsense. I changed me damage type to **fire**, swung me mighty axe, and **cooked two of the doughballs** in an instant. They **sizzled** and crackled as the flames roasted them, turnin' them into crispy lumps.

---

### **Kax’s Ridiculous Plan (Where Grulk Knocks Out Dough)**

Then **Kax**, the sorcerer, has the brilliant idea to **keep one alive**.

“**WHAT?!**” I shouted, veins bulgin’. “**It’s dough, ye fool! Keep it alive?**”

But fine, if that’s what the brainy one wanted, I’d oblige. I swung me axe with just enough restraint to **knock the doughball out**. Don’t ask me how—**only a warrior of Grulk’s might** could manage that.

I didn’t care though. After I knocked it out, I **chomped down** on one o' the dead doughballs. _Tasted like victory._

---

### **Inside the Fort: Grulk the Locksmith (Where Grulk Does a Rogue’s Job)**

We cleared the courtyard and found ourselves in a **hallway**, full o' fancy things like **tapestries, tables, and bookshelves**. There was a **wooden chest** in the corner, and **Kax**, bein' the ever-curious sorcerer, asked me to “**look at it**.”

I gave him the full rundown: “**It’s a wooden chest, locked, hinges on the back, metal bandin'. About two feet wide, three feet long.**”

“**OPEN IT!**” he yelled. Bah! I smashed the lock with **one punch**.

Inside, we found a **golden dragon statuette**, some **silk robes**, a **pouch of gold**, and a **jewelled brooch**. Fancy stuff, but **Grulk don’t care for treasure**—**Grulk cares for battle**.

---

### **The Pie of Legend (Or Just a Pie)**

In the **kitchen**, we finally found the **festival pie**—a massive pie sittin' on a table, just waitin' for us.

We checked it, found a few **nibbles in it**, but nothin' serious. **Wentri poked it** just to make sure it wasn’t alive (after fightin’ doughballs, ye can never be sure), but it was just a pie.

“**Finally, we got the damn thing,**” I grumbled.

---

### **The Pieman and His Golems (Where Grulk Takes on Pastry Monsters)**

So there I was, starin' down these **pastry golems**—real tough-lookin' beasts, big as trolls with **rolling pins for arms**, and tougher than any doughball. They started swingin' at us, tryin' to **flatten us into the ground** like dough. But ye can’t flatten **Grulk**! I’d already **crushed** the bandit leader, the **Pieman**, with a good smack from the blunt side of me axe, but now it was time to deal with these **baked monstrosities**.

### **The Golem Fight (Where Grulk's Strength Shines)**

I **charged forward**, me massive axe ready. When **Grulk rages**, I tower over the battlefield, **12 feet tall**, a mountain o' muscle with **fire burnin’ in me eyes**. I swung me axe, and the blade bit into the **pastry golem’s doughy skin**—but it didn’t go down easy. This thing was **tough as stone**, and it swung back at me with its **rolling pin**.

### **Step 1: Grulk Takes the Hit—**

The golem's **rolling pin** slammed into me, knockin’ me back a step. But **Grulk don’t fall**! I wiped the dough from me face and let out a mighty **roar**, diggin' me heels into the ground. I swung again, **smashin' the golem’s side** with a thunderous blow, but still, the creature stood.

Meanwhile, **Kax** was tossin' spells from the back, hittin’ the golem with firebolts, but it just **kept on comin'**. The golems were relentless, swingin' those **damned rolling pins** like they were tryin’ to bake us into pies ourselves. **Wentri** was mutterin’ somethin’ about **blight spells**, but his magic wasn’t much good here—it seemed these golems weren’t **natural**, so his **plant magic** didn’t hurt ‘em like it should.

### **Step 2: Grulk Brings the Pain—**

With **one massive blow**, I finally **cracked through the doughy hide** of the first golem, **splatterin' it across the floor** in a pile o' gooey mess. Custard and dough flew everywhere—**Grulk had conquered another enemy**! But the battle wasn’t over yet—**more golems** kept comin’, rollin' toward us like a **baked army**.

**Kax**, ever the smartass, used the **unconscious pieman** as a **shield**. Hah! Cowardly, but effective. He lobbed firebolts from behind his human doughboy, while **Wentri** got hit square in the face with a **custard explosion** from another golem.

“**Ye’re no good with these pies, mushroom man!**” I shouted, as I swung me axe at another golem, **cleavin’ it clean in half**.

---

### **The Thunderstep and Final Smashes (Where Grulk Ends It)**

At this point, things were gettin' dire. The golems were tough, and **Kax**—thinkin’ quick—decided to **Thunderstep** the **unconscious pieman** outta harm’s way. A **crack o’ thunder** echoed through the room as he disappeared in a flash of light, leavin’ **Grulk** and **Wentri** to finish off the last golem.

I could feel the **rage risin'**, blood poundin' in me ears, and I let loose with a string o' blows that would’ve brought down a mountain. Me axe sang through the air, **swing after swing**, until the last golem stood **crumblin' before me**.

But as I swung the final blow, **Kax**—the fool—**missed a firebolt** and **hit Grulk instead!** The flames seared across me arm, causin' me pain.

I turned and gave **Kax the evil eye**—the kind o’ look that could freeze a man’s soul—but instead o' bashin' him, I **imagined** the last golem **was Kax** and let loose with me axe.

“**ARRRRRRRGGGHHHH!**” I roared, and the final golem **crumbled to dust** beneath the power of **Grulk’s fury**.

---

### **Interrogation and Loot (Where Grulk Eats His Victory)**

With the fight over, **Kax woke up the Pieman**, and **intimidated him** into spillin' his guts. Turns out, his **friend** made the golems—someone who was **long dead now**. He stole the pies every year **just ‘cause he liked them**. A bloody fool, but it didn’t matter now—**Grulk had his victory**.

We decided to drag the **Pieman** back to the village to let them deal with him. But before we left, we **searched the fort**, findin’ all sorts o' useful things:
- **Mushrooms**
- **Pies**
- Some **weapons**
- A small **bag o’ coins**—25gp
- **Maps**, showin’ **ambush sites, trade routes,** and places marked as too dangerous.

---

### **The Pie Chase Fiasco (Where Grulk Fell on His Face—Twice)**

Now that we had the **festival pie**, we loaded it onto a cart and started takin' it back to the village. But as we went, the **damn pie slipped** off the cart.

I **chased after it**, but wouldn’t ye know it—I **tripped** and went **face-first into the dirt**. I scrambled to me feet, only to **trip again**, fallin' on me face a second time.

**Kax** tried to catch the pie, but he failed just as miserably. Finally, it was **Wentri** who saved the day, catchin’ the pie with his **druid magic** before it rolled off a cliff.

---

### **Victory and Conquest (Where Grulk Took the Village)**

We returned to **Crustward** with the pie, and the village rewarded us with a hefty **1000gp** for savin' their festival. But that wasn’t the end of it.

**Kax**, always the clever one, convinced the village to make the **Pieman** their **new security consultant**. Turns out, the man knew more about traps and defenses than anyone else, and he was better than the fools they already had.

In the end, **we took over the village**. We sent some guards to keep the peace, and we walked away with **the deeds to Crustward**. Now, the village is **ours**—and **Grulk Frostblood** is the proud owner o' a **town of fools**.

---

### **End of Session (Where Grulk Wins Again)**

And there ye have it, the **full tale** of **Grulk the Mighty** in the **Pie Caper**. From bandits to doughballs to **pastry golems**, no one stood a chance against **me axe** and **me fury**. 

Another day, another village conquered, and once again, **Grulk’s legend grows**. Whether it’s pies or monsters, **Grulk always wins**.
