## Recap

The session begins with the party exiting the lively tavern, where Xadira catches sight of a hooded figure on a nearby rooftop. The figure nods and disappears into the night, prompting the group to cautiously move into a dark alley. Workax notices the astrolabe he carries is beginning to melt, but Pim manages to teleport the group to their next destination—though upon arrival, both Wentri and Xadira fall ill from the strain of the journey.

As they gather their bearings, an owlbear emerges from the woods. Eldrin successfully communicates with the creature, learning about the wolves lurking ahead. The party then proceeds into the forest, which feels unnaturally eerie and alive, with twisted trees and a thick mist covering the ground. Strange whispers surround them, adding to the tension. Wentri, undeterred by the ominous atmosphere, finds some glowing mushrooms. His attempt to harvest one results in an explosion, but he perseveres and manages to collect another without incident.

Xadira leads the way deeper into the forest, and the party soon encounters an archway covered in glowing runes with a recess for a hand. The runes promise healing, but the group hesitates. Grulk, uninterested in waiting, places his hand in the recess, activating a portal. They step through, finding themselves in a peaceful glade. However, unsettling whispers continue to haunt them, unnerving everyone except Workax and Grulk.

The party then reaches a swift river, and Xadira uses her Cloak of Manta Ray to dive in with a rope, but the current is too strong, and she is nearly swept away. Grulk saves her, jumping across the river effortlessly, while Eldrin shapeshifts into an owlbear to carry Wentri and Pim across. As Wentri approaches the river, the water parts, allowing him to walk across with ease—earning him the nickname "owlbear Moses."

As they continue on, the group is suddenly separated by a flash of light, each member facing their own personal fears. Grulk charges at a fire giant in his vision, only to realize it's an illusion. Eldrin panics in owlbear form, and Pim is haunted by a scene of his mentor being attacked. Xadira, Wentri, and Workax, unaffected by the illusions, help bring their companions back to reality. Grulk, still in a rage, demands to know where the fire giant went.

The party moves forward and comes to a stone bridge guarded by two stone golems. As they attempt to cross, parts of the bridge collapse, and Wentri struggles repeatedly to make it across, often falling into the chasm below. Grulk grows increasingly frustrated and simply walks across, later offering Workax and Wentri as "payments" to the golems. When the golems demand a personal sacrifice, a battle ensues. Grulk smashes one golem to pieces while Workax uses magic to send the other tumbling off the bridge. Victorious, the group searches the area but finds nothing of value.

The climb up the mountain that follows is arduous, with steep, crumbling paths and biting cold. Grulk once again plays the role of rescuer, pulling the others to safety as they slip and fall. The cold affects the group severely, though Grulk remains unbothered, even joking about sunbathing in the frigid air. After a long and treacherous climb, they reach another portal.

Stepping through, the party finds themselves in a peaceful valley with a humble shrine. A mysterious being appears, speaking cryptically about mercy and the heart leading the way. Pim takes charge, tending to a wounded pilgrim who reveals that the way forward requires an emotional sacrifice. As the group presses on, they encounter a starving village, where Wentri conjures food for the desperate villagers, earning their gratitude and a potion of restoration.

The journey continues, and the party encounters a twisted, shadowy beast that Pim recognizes as his corrupted friend, Echion. Pim cleanses him with the essence of renewal, and Echion thanks him before disappearing, leaving the party feeling blessed with newfound wisdom.

Soon after, a shadowy figure, Seraphina Shadowbloom, confronts the group, followed by an attack from Vaen Silversong. The battle is fierce but short, with Seraphina fleeing after taking damage and Vaen attacking in a rage. The party emerges victorious once more, though Grulk is quick to claim most of the credit for their success.

After taking a long rest in a quiet lounge, the group faces a new challenge: a riddle involving pedestals, a mirror, an unlit candle, and a statue. Despite the others’ best efforts, it is Grulk who solves the puzzle, much to everyone’s surprise, and the door opens, allowing them to proceed.

At last, they arrive at a room with a floating chalice. Pim reaches out to claim it, but shadows rise from the floor, forming into a menacing figure—the High Abbot—who declares Pim unworthy. As the room fills with dark energy, the party braces for their next challenge, with Grulk eager to meet the Abbot in battle.

## Session 34 – Grulk's Saga

### Roll Call of the Warriors

Workax Dreyman – A half-elf sorcerer who thinks his spells solve more than Grulk’s axe. He tried to out-drink Grulk once—lost badly. He's useful for fireballs, I suppose, but no match for true might. He often underestimates the power of brute force, and that's why Grulk always has to save the day.

Wentri Sporesnore – A gnome druid, always smellin’ like moss and dirt. Once saved Grulk from a giant centipede, so I let him walk ahead sometimes. His magic can be useful, especially when it comes to dealing with nature nonsense, but he talks to plants more than Grulk thinks is healthy. There was one time he convinced a tree not to fall on us—I'll give him credit for that.

Grulk Frostblood – THAT’S ME! The mightiest frost giant (ignore the goblin nonsense). Stronger than a thousand yaks and twice as smart. Grulk leads, Grulk wins, Grulk crushes enemies beneath his mighty boots. Anyone who doubts it gets a face full of axe. End of story.

Eldrin Greenwalker – An elf druid who thinks he’s wild. Turned into a wolf once, tried to lead a pack—Grulk had to step in and show real leadership. He’s useful enough, with his shape-shifting and fancy animal tricks. At least he knows when to follow orders, especially when Grulk is involved. Sometimes, Eldrin’s magic can actually come in handy—like the time he turned into a bear and smashed a whole group of skeletons to bits.

Pim – A halfling monk, fast and punchy. Fights beside Grulk without hesitation, which I respect—even if he's the size of my foot. Pim’s quick, and his fists are like little hammers. I’ve seen him take down creatures twice his size, which makes Grulk think he's almost frost giant material. Almost. He keeps me entertained with his antics, and he's always the first into the fray. That counts for somethin'.

### THE HIGH ABBOT AND THE CAVE OF FIRE!

We faced the High Abbot, who thought chantin’ would save him. He sent us to a stinkin’ lava cave. The heat was intense, like standing in the belly of a forge, the walls glowing a fiery red that promised only pain. The air shimmered with the oppressive heat, waves of it distorting the rocky terrain. But Grulk doesn’t back down—never has, never will. Heat means nothing when the heart is colder than winter’s fury.

The Abbot’s smug face would soon learn the folly of his ways. Kax, our fire-loving sorcerer, took the first move, conjuring a massive fireball. It blasted towards the Abbot, lighting up the cavern like a goblin festival gone wrong. The explosion rocked the very ground, flames dancing across the dais. Grulk, never one to hesitate, charged like an avalanche breaking free from the tallest mountain peak. My roar echoed across the cave, shaking the air itself, a primal sound of rage and power.

I THREW my axe, not once, but twice—each hit landed with the force of a glacier, crunching bone beneath his robes. His screams were like music, a tune that only fueled my rage. Wentri and Pim followed behind, scrambling to catch up. Pim moved like lightning, his tiny fists a blur as he battered the Abbot, while Eldrin whispered ancient words to boost my power. The echoes of each strike were like the drumbeats of the gods themselves, and I could feel the surge of strength as Eldrin's magic coursed through me. The Abbot faltered, his confidence melting away like snow under a summer sun, his eyes widening as he realized what he was up against.

### THE MONK AND THE SKELETON HOARD

The Abbot screamed, his voice desperate, and with a flick of his bony hands, the ground split, and out came skeletons, rattling and clanking, weapons drawn. Their empty eye sockets glowed with the eerie green of the underworld, a ghastly light that seemed to suck the warmth out of the cavern. Each skeleton moved with an unnatural stiffness, their joints creaking as if protesting their very existence. Then he cast another spell, a wave of darkness that ripped through us—an unholy force that clawed at our minds and bodies. Grulk staggered, but still standin', teeth bared in defiance. The others didn’t fare as well. I saw Pim brace himself, the tiny monk's muscles tensing against the pain, Wentri shivering like a leaf in a winter storm, and Eldrin barely on his feet, his face pale and drawn. The air was thick with despair, a tangible weight that seemed to press down on us. But the worst was yet to come.

The Abbot, in his cowardice, charmed us! Imagine that—turning Grulk’s mighty rage into a pitiful smile, forcing me to wave at skeletons like they were old friends, a twisted grin stretched across my face. Bah! My mind screamed, but my body obeyed the foul magic. Pim and Eldrin managed to resist the charm, their bodies glowing with determination, eyes set like steel. They fought on while I was stuck, grinning like a fool, my axe hanging useless by my side. Eldrin, in a desperate move, transformed into an owlbear—feathers and fury, roaring and thrashing with a primal might. He lunged at the Abbot, swiping with talons that could tear through armor, making the Abbot dance between his strikes, his robes fluttering like a scared bird. Pim was relentless, dodging between the skeletons, striking pressure points with deadly precision. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the charm shattered. My rage returned, burning hotter than ever, a fury like the heart of a winter storm unleashed. My muscles surged with strength as I gripped my axe, ready to end this once and for all.

With two mighty swings, I sent the Abbot crumpling to the ground, his blood staining the dais in dark crimson streaks. His body hit the stone with a sickening thud, his once smug expression now frozen in shock and fear. The skeletons that had rallied to his call began to shudder and shake, their bones rattling as if they knew their end was near. One by one, they collapsed, their eerie green eye sockets flickering out, their forms disintegrating into piles of dust. The screams of the skeletons turned to silence, the clamor of battle fading into an almost eerie quiet, leaving behind only the echoes of our triumph. The cavern seemed to hold its breath, the only sound the heavy breathing of my companions and the fading clang of metal on stone. I planted my axe firmly on the ground, standing tall, surveying the aftermath with a sense of grim satisfaction. We had done it—the mighty Abbot was no more, and his army of the undead reduced to nothingness. The dais was ours, and with it, the bitter taste of hard-won victory.

### TREASURES AND TRINKETS

After the fight, we found ourselves teleported back to the altar room—a strange place with walls covered in old carvings and dusty trinkets. Pim, his eyes always on the prize, grabbed a shiny chalice. Somethin' about "helpin' healers." Bah, Grulk heals with steel, not cups!

We rummaged around the altar, finding a bunch of old books and a cookbook that caught Wentri's eye. He seemed happy, babbling about recipes for stew or some nonsense. Grulk paid it no mind. We took a rest, mostly for the spell-slingers. They needed their precious magic back. Me? I just sharpened my axe, letting the familiar sound keep me awake while the others slept. The flickering light of the torches danced across the walls, shadows shifting like ghosts, but I wasn’t afraid. Grulk fears no ghost, no shadow. Only thing I fear is a dull blade.

### A VILLAGE OF CORPSES AND A FINE HAT

We set off after that, we left through another portal and arrived where we had started, in the woods. Kax led us to a village he knew. What we found was rubble—corpses, rot, and ruin. The stench was thick, a reminder of past horrors. The entire place was flattened, with nothing left standing except a few charred beams sticking up like broken ribs from the earth. But in the midst of all that decay, Grulk’s sharp eyes found somethin’ worthwhile—a fine leather hat, complete with a feather. Now it sits upon my glorious head, adding to my already immense stature.

We also found draft horses, three of 'em, wandering among the wreckage, their eyes wide with fear. I claimed one—named him Loctite, just in case he ever needed a reminder of his fate if he got lazy. The others gave me funny looks, but what do they know? The horse tried to buck me off once—I showed it who was boss. Loctite’s mine now, a companion on our journey whether he likes it or not.

### THE HORSES AND THE VILLAGE OF DEATH

We moved on, with Pim mumblin’ about voices in his head, babbling about "healing, peace, yada yada." More nonsense, if you ask me. We used some magic astrolabe to end up in Dragontail. The journey wasn’t without humour—horses threw up all over Pim and Wentri. Best part of the day, if I’m honest. Nothin’ says adventure like a horse’s breakfast on a companion. Pim tried to clean himself up, muttering curses under his breath, while Wentri looked like he was ready to disappear into the earth.

Once we reached Dragontail, we headed straight to the tavern. Grulk drank until the world seemed to blur—a glorious stupor! The others were off whispering about some hooded figure and protectin' or killin' Kax. Who cares? Grulk sang songs, broke a table, and won the respect of the locals through sheer presence and strength. One of the locals even tried arm wrestling me—poor soul didn’t know what he was getting into. His arm hit the table so hard, I thought it’d snap like a twig. The cheers afterward were deafening, and I basked in it, knowing that even here, far from home, Grulk’s legend grows.

### THE CORRUPTED VALLEY AND THE BRIDGE OF SCREAMS

The next mornin’, we traveled to the Gate of Reflection, an ancient pathway said to hold deep meaning for those seeking peace. An old monk sat there, preachin' restraint and calm. I laughed in his face—real strength comes from a heavy axe, not meditatin'. We took our horses, despite his grumblin', and headed into a valley that seemed dead—trees brittle as bones and whispers hanging in the air, like memories of sorrow. The corruption was thick, like a black fog clinging to everything, a blight that seemed to suck the very life out of the land.

Pim and Wentri were nearly overwhelmed by the spirits’ sorrow. They heard voices, cries of failure and loss. It tugged at them, made their eyes water. We helped those spirits find some semblance of peace, and Grulk totally didn’t cry—there was dust, alright?! Spirits or no, I don’t cry. But seeing them fade away brought a strange stillness to the valley, and for a moment, even I felt somethin'. It was like the land itself breathed a sigh of relief, the whispers fading into silence. Wentri said some druid nonsense about restoring balance, but all I cared about was moving forward.

### THE BRIDGE OF SCREAMS

We moved on and came to a bridge; beneath it, nothing but a dark abyss. As we crossed, spirits screamed our names, each one louder than the last. Pim almost fell, then Kax stumbled, and Wentri tumbled right off—luckily Eldrin caught him with his magic. When it came to Grulk’s turn? HA! I strode across like it was solid stone, yelling back at those spirits to quit their wailin’ or face Grulk’s wrath. Seemed to work—they hushed right up. I felt the chill of their presence, their hands brushing at my legs, trying to pull me down, but Grulk fears no ghost. I stomped, and they scattered, their wails turning into whispers before fading away.

And thus, the session ended with Grulk victorious, a hat upon his head, and enemies crushed beneath his mighty boots. There’s nothin' quite like the feelin' of a hard-won victory and the taste of ale afterward. The others may have had their parts to play, but make no mistake—it was Grulk’s strength that saw us through. They’ll learn, in time, that when Grulk leads, victory is assured.

There ye have it! A true saga of blood, battle, and vomit. Grulk leads to victory—or at least Grulk's part, which is all that matters. Now, where’s my ale?!
