**Session 28 – The Tale of Grulk Frostblood's Total Domination**

So there we are, standin' around in some dirt-suckin' clearing, mindin' our own business, when a **scaled-up Dragonborn bastard** comes stormin’ at us like he’s got somethin’ to prove. **HA! FOOL.** 

This lizard starts flappin’ his gums, goin' on about how his brother’s dead. *BOO-HOO.* “My brother this, my brother that,” as if we give a frozen rat’s ass about it. Kax, the big ox-headed numbskull, thinks this is a chance to talk. *Talkin'?!* **GRULK DON’T TALK! GRULK SMASH!**

Before Kax can open his trap for another wasted word, **the dragonborn lunges at him.** But **I’ve already had enough** of this lizard’s whining, so **I RAGE OUT!** The bloodlust fills me, my veins ice over with fury, and I charge like an avalanche down the side of a mountain!

I don’t hesitate—**my axe sings through the air** with the sound of breakin’ bones. One swing, and that **dragonborn fool’s insides are splattered across the snow.** **HA! DEAD!** Just like that. I don’t care that Kax wanted to question him—questions are for the weak! I turn to the rest of ‘em with a grin on my face, **dragonborn guts drippin’ off my axe.** 

*Oops.* Guess they wanted to talk, but **too late now!**

---

We set off for Dragontail next. *Ugh, more walkin’, more yappin’.* **Grulk hates travel.** The cold wind cuts through us like knives, but that just makes **Grulk stronger.** Weaklings complain, but not **Grulk Frostblood**—I could walk through a thousand blizzards and **still rip the arms off a frost troll** by the end of it!

But then, we come across a cart. Not just any cart, either—this one’s got a **dead body** draped over it like a frozen sack of potatoes. And guess what? **Pim, the weepy-eyed rat,** recognizes her. Calls her **Kaylien.** *Pim’s "good friend."*

**HA!** Yeah, good friend my frozen ass. Everyone knows they were **doin’ the dirty.** *Kaylien and Pim, sittin’ in a tree, S.C.R.E.W.I.N.G!* Pim tries to play it all sad and serious, but **Grulk sees right through it.**

Turns out Kaylien was carryin' a **half-burned map** to some monastery or shrine or whatever. Pim gets all weepy-eyed and wants to bury her—probably ‘cause she was deliverin’ somethin’. *Maybe a pizza, maybe some boring relic—who cares?* I ain’t diggin’ holes when **there’s killin’ to be done!**

---

There are **footprints.** We follow. And as we track ‘em, the prints start gettin’ lighter, like whoever left 'em was carryin’ somethin’ and dropped it. Then we find a **feather.** Some fancy assassin mark, says Pim. *Silent Sun*, they call ‘em. **Assassins! Cowards, more like it.**

Then, outta nowhere, some half-dead fool named **Tao** stumbles into our path. Looks like he just got chewed up and spit out by a frost bear. He starts goin’ on about how **assassins attacked him**—said there were at least five of ‘em, Silent Sun bastards, burnin’ up everything in their path. They were after some **shard**—a magic rock that can heal and bring people back to life. Useful for good, useful for evil. **Blah, blah.** I don’t care. If it’s shiny, **Grulk’ll take it.**

Pim? Pim wants it back. Says it’s important. Well, if it means **more killin’**, then Grulk’s all in.

---

We find ourselves at a **stone circle**, and Tao says there’s **teleportation magic** or some crap. But here’s where **Grulk steps up to save the day**—turns out **Grulk speaks Celestial!** Yeah, ya heard me! The rest of these fools can barely read, and I’m out here readin’ holy runes like they’re written in fresh blood. 

I **read the words,** speak the ancient tongue, and **BOOM!** We teleport straight into the assassin’s hideout.

Now, Tao starts tremblin’ like a snow hare in a wolf’s jaws. Says he don’t want to be here. *HA! TOUGH LUCK, BUDDY!* I tell him straight—if his order’s corrupt, then maybe he’s the rotten one. **Grulk ain’t no fool.**

---

As we sneak through the hideout, we hear some fools chattin’. They’re talkin’ about **Leora**—Pim’s old trainer. They want her to “join them.” *HA! She can join ‘em in death, once I’m done with ‘em!* 

Eldrin casts his sneaky spell, and we creep around like a bunch of mice. But **Grulk’s blood is boilin’.** I can barely hold back the rage—I’m itchin’ to start swingin’. **I NEED TO SMASH.**

We find some **letters** talkin’ about a guy named **Jinx**—who the hell is Jinx?! Don’t matter. I don’t care about letters. **Grulk only cares about SMASHIN’.**

---

Then, we hear more talk about smugglin’ someone in—**someone pregnant,** sounds like. And they say **anyone who sees gets killed.** *Well, good luck tryin’ to kill Grulk, you gutless worms!* 

Finally, **we come across a couple of them Silent Sun bastards** tryin’ to take over the Silver Dawn. *AND THAT’S WHEN THE FUN STARTS!* I don’t wait for the rest of ‘em to decide. **I CHARGE!** **I RAGE!** **I DESTROY!**

The big one with the shard? **He’s mine.** **One swing,** and his head goes flyin’ off his neck like a chunk of ice thrown off a cliff. His guts spill out like a feast for the wolves. **HA!** The others are tryin’ to help, but **Eldrin screws up,** misses his mark, and **hits Pim!** 

**HAH! FOOLS!**

But no matter—**we win.** ‘Cause **Grulk’s there. Grulk always wins.**

---

Now, the door bursts open, and we storm into this big-ass room. **Tables, chairs, weapon racks, chests, barrels—BOOZE!** That’s what I’m talkin’ about! I’m halfway to grabbin’ a barrel when that idiot **Pim touches a statue.**

And guess what? **The statues come to life.**

---

**THIS IS IT.** THIS is where **Grulk shines!** Three massive stone statues, bigger than any frost giant, come stompin’ toward us. The others? **They’re useless.** Pim’s down in two seconds flat, Eldrin’s flingin' spells but hittin’ nothin', and Kax? **Bah, he’s just standin’ there.**

**BUT GRULK? GRULK IS READY!**

I charge straight at the biggest statue, **my axe in hand, screamin’ like a blizzard’s howlin' through the mountains!** I swing at its knee—**CRACK!** The stone splits under the force of my blow, but it ain’t done yet. The bastard swings its giant fist at me, thinkin’ it can squash me like a bug. **HAH! TOO SLOW!**

**I leap onto its arm, climbin’ it like a mountain goat scaling the peaks!** I’m on its shoulder in seconds, **face to face with this stone giant,** and **I slam my axe right into its skull!** **CRACK!** The stone shatters, but it’s still movin’. I leap off, land on the ground, and **tear its leg clean off with a single swing!** 

**ONE DOWN.**

---

Next one tries to blindside me, but I see it comin’. I **grab the severed arm of the first statue** and **beat the second one with it!** **CRACK! SMASH!** Stone flies everywhere. **TWO DOWN.**

The last one tries to land a punch, but **I’m faster.** **I charge, roar like a gods-damned avalanche,** and **tear its chest open with my bare hands!** Stone crumbles at

**HAH! You want MORE?** Good! Because I ain't even **close** to done! The best part’s still to come, so sit yer weak asses down and listen, ‘cause this is where **Grulk’s legend truly takes shape!**

---

So, there I am, standin’ amidst the **crumblin’ rubble** of two statues I’ve already turned to gravel, and the third one—oh, this last big dumb hunk o’ rock—is still standin’, thinkin’ it’s got a chance. **HA! FOOL.**

It swings at me, **but Grulk’s too fast!** The stone fist comes down like a glacier fallin’, but I’m already movin’. I dodge to the side, feel the wind from that massive punch blow past, but **I don’t stop!**

**I roar—a thunderous, ground-shakin’ bellow that rattles the whole damn room!** The walls tremble, dust falls from the ceiling, and the rest of these puny folk? They’re still draggin’ their sorry hides outta the dirt, but not **Grulk!** 

**I charge, axe raised high, blood pumpin’ like a river of molten ice!**

The last statue’s got nothin’ left. It’s slow, dumb, and I can see **the fear in its stone eyes.** It knows it’s done for. With a single leap, **I’m on it,** climbin’ up its leg, swingin’ my axe into its side—**CRUNCH!** Stone cracks, chips fly everywhere, but I ain’t done yet. Oh no, **Grulk never stops!**

---

I scramble up its back like a damned **frost wolf on the hunt,** diggin’ my fingers into its cold, hard stone like it’s soft snow. My axe comes down again—**THUNK!** I bury it deep into its shoulder, feel the stone givin’ way under my strength. 

The thing’s staggerin’, tryin’ to throw me off, but I **won’t be moved!** I grip its shoulders, yank my axe free, and with **one final, ferocious swing**, **I TAKE ITS DAMNED HEAD OFF!** 

**CRACK!** The statue’s head falls to the ground like a boulder tumblin’ off a cliff, shatterin’ into a thousand pieces when it hits. The rest of the body? **It crumbles, collapsin’ beneath my feet, and I ride it down to the ground like a gods-damned KING.**

---

And then… **it’s over.** 

The room is still, except for the sound of dust settlin' and the groans of the others tryin’ to pull themselves together. **Three statues, once mighty and terrifying, now lay in pieces at my feet.** The rest of ‘em—**Pim, Kax, Eldrin—they’re all standin' there, starin’ at me like they’ve just seen a god.** 

**And maybe they have.**

I stand tall, **covered in stone dust, blood still drippin’ from a cut on my head,** but I don’t feel it. I’m **invincible.** 

**Grulk Frostblood, Slayer of Giants, Crusher of Stone.** 

They’ll sing songs about this day. They’ll carve my name into the mountains themselves, so every fool who wanders these lands will know who truly rules this world. **ME.**

---

But it ain’t over yet. Oh no, **Grulk don’t rest.** After I’m done smashin’ those statues, we find a **secret door.** More mystery nonsense, more ancient runes. Some mumbo jumbo about truth, purity, time, and all that garbage. **Blah, blah, blah—Grulk’ll smash through it if needed.**

But instead of breakin’ it down, we follow the clues like good little lapdogs, and soon enough, we’re face to face with a solid **wooden door, ironbound, runes etched into the surface.** 

**“In the shadow of time, where secrets sleep,”** the runes say. **“Only the pure of heart shall the gatekeeper keep.”** 

**HA!** *Pure of heart?* I laugh at that. **Grulk’s pure in the only thing that matters—RAGE.** And if this gatekeeper don’t open up, I’ll **split ‘em in two just like everything else in my path!**

---

But there’s somethin’ more here—somethin’ deeper. Behind this door, there’s power. I can **feel it, like the frostbite on my skin before a storm.** And whatever’s behind this door, I know one thing: **Grulk will claim it.**

And that’s where we left off, standin’ before the unknown, but knowin’ that whatever comes next, **Grulk Frostblood will tear it apart with his bare hands.**

---

**END OF SESSION.** You think it’s over? **HA!** Not until I say it is, but for now, rest yer ears. You’ll need ‘em for the next tale of **Grulk’s unstoppable fury!**
