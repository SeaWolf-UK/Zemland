We wake the next morning in the Goblin Camp.  The [[Kingdom of Zemland/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic\|mimic]] has devoured most of the dead goblins.

[[Kori\|Kori]]  sees some level of sense and questions how safe we are with the mimic in the party, but then ruins the sense of relief to see someone with a modicum of intelligence by saying it probably doesn't matter.

***AAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH***

We leave the camp and come to a cross roads in the woodland.
- Despite being his homeland, [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] doesn't know the way........

We go to the hamlet.  [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] home - what a shite hole.  A small hamlet with a handful of houses, where the Silversong family run a Haberdashery and Millinery.  A bleeding high class tailoring outfitters in a pissant town.  How the hell do they make money.  ![Hamlet.webp|400](/img/user/Kingdom%20of%20Zemland/z_Attachments/Hamlet.webp)

We go to [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] home.

		- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  wants to be left alone no matter what.
			- She has no idea how the clan are tracking the missing survivors.

Whilst we are having a meal, some more travellers arrive in the hamlet.
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] father goes to greet them.
	- He returns saying they are fine....
		- He's lying through his teeth ([[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] insight check )
		- Something seems off.
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Workax Dreyman\|Workax Dreyman]] goes to speak to the travellers
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] goes to join him as she is getting vibes that something is off.
		- The travellers seem very cagey and even become very obstructive

The cart goes away.

Kax and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] follow the travellers.
- We follow until they camp.

	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] sneaks into camp and and search the cart.

	- Wake cart owner and question.

- We return to the hamlet

We get back to [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] family home and are offered a room to spend the night

Before settling in for the night, [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] parents go around the house and board up the windows, check the doors are locked etc.  A typical scared of what's out there at night type routine.
- No one really questions it.

At night there is a loud scream.

We question the parents about what is going on.
- There is an old abandoned tower on the outskirts of town
	- Several people have gone missing in the vicinity
	- The group want to go to the spooky tower at night.

		She detects [[Kingdom of Zemland/compendium/bestiary/undead/undead\|undead]] and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] 

As we get closer the vision of the tower is an illusion and it is whole and complete - it appears that this could be a necromancers deal in hiding their domicile.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] scouts the outside of the tower.  Only 1 entrance. The walls are climbable, but only for her.  The others won't stand a chance.

	- It's happening again.
		- Necromancers taking people from path near town
		- Turning into thralls (undead)
		- So [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]]'s parents  knew that something like this had happened before, yet they didn't tell us - or more so their son.
			- In fact as [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] grew up here, why the hell didn't he know about these tales.
			- At the very least it would have been the "Keep away from the tower else the necromancer will get you" type thing.
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] siblings say they heard of someone called Grace/Candy/Grace Candy who is helping necromancers.

						- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] has thoughts about this is why [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]]'s father let those travellers go so easily as agreement to to the people that he/they owe the money to.
							- Does this mean that they are working for [[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]] /The [[Kingdom of Zemland/5. Lore/Organisations/Cult of Tiamat\|Cult of Tiamat]] in order to clear their debt?
