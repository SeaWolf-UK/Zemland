[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] 

We continue from last time:

We storm the room where "[[Kingdom of Zemland/2. NPCs/Enemies/Ella\|Ella]]" is.
 - Inside is a Lizard folk and a hooded female holding a set of scissors and a bloody tongue.
	- Combat.
		- We win.
Turns out that the hooded figure wasn't Ella
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  recognises her as one of the Vampire Spawn from the City.
	- Ahh well, I did warn them that next time we saw them there would be problems

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  goes and frees the sex slaves that wouldn't leave the basement.
 - The rest of the party are trying to discuss where to send them, or how much money to give them.
 - [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  just asks "Why don't they run the brothel themselves if they have no-where left to go to"
	 - The former sex slaves like this idea and say that that is what they will do.

We talk about what to do next.
- K
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/3. Locations/Places of Interest/Belly of the Beast\|Belly of the Beast]] .
	- ritual sacrifice
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/3. Locations/Town/Stillrest\|Stillrest]] 

Whilst talking Seraphina spots a Dwarven woman speaking to a child.
- The mother is chastising the child
- ![2024-04-14-20240420150646373.webp|500](/img/user/Kingdom%20of%20Zemland/z_Attachments/2024-04-14-20240420150646373.webp)
- They leave the area

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  follows Dwarven mother and child.
- Go to a small house.
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  listens at the doorway
- "We cannot do this, the more we talk the more chances they have of finding us."
	- Mother trying to Scare child 
	- Uses the name Kara (K?)
		- [[Kingdom of Zemland/compendium/classes/rogue\|rogue]] 
		- Turns out K(ara) is a passing Acquaintance of [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] 
			- Could be either help or hinderance.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  goes back to the party and explains the situation that K is definitely in town and turns out she know her.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] shapeshifts to a Dwarven child and goes and speak to the child.
- Family owes money to Kara.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  goes speaks to a member of the local Thieves Guild.  Arrange to meet Kara.

An operation of this size and complexity needs the local authorities to look the other way.
 - Despite this being standard in nearly all civilised areas, they group appear to be upset and go see Mayor.
- They ask if he is aware of slavery
	- He says no.
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  detects BS
	- Threatens Mayor (So much for being a Knight of honour (Oath of Devotion))
	- He admits to know what is going on.
		- He gets 200gp per day from K, or more specifically the Black Paw, to look the other way.
		- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]], out of nowhere, tries to kill the mayor. 
		- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
			- ![2024-04-14-20240417210748068.webp|500](/img/user/Kingdom%20of%20Zemland/z_Attachments/2024-04-14-20240417210748068.webp)
			- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  trips her and prevents her from killing the mayor.
				- So, so far in this town alone we theorise that he killed the person he came to see, Archibald, and set the house on fire, probably to hide the crime.  And now tried to kill the Mayor, an unarmed non-combatant.
			- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]] seriously has to go one way or another.
				- The one thing Vesper always instilled in [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] was to always have an exit strategy, and to know your enemies weaknesses.  Always have a Tower of Babel plan, and she does.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] has had enough and goes to speaks with Kara.
- May have a more productive and rational conversation with the slaver and evil person.
- K is Kara.
	- Member of the Black Paw	
		- Talk about old times.
		- Pays off the Dwarfs debt.
			- Kay is happy
				- Tells [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] to tell the Dwarves to leave town and never return.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  returns to the group

The others still have the mayor hog tied and still don't know what to do.
- if we act this way to every corrupt official that there may be, we will have the entire world after us, and still not achieve anything.

Outside there is a scream.
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Kori\|Kori]] go to see what is going on as they are the only ones who hear it.
- The others follow to see what is going on.
- A woman is creaming that her child has been taken.
	- Amazing that no-one in the area tried to help.
	- Pointing we see 2 hooded people dragging the child off.
		- Combat.
			- We win.
	- We return the child and ask why they took the child.
		- She has no idea.
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] says "Can you say distraction"

We return to the mayors office.

The mayor has gone, ropes have been cut.
![2024-04-14-20240420153151900.webp|500](/img/user/Kingdom%20of%20Zemland/z_Attachments/2024-04-14-20240420153151900.webp)
- Note on table saying he's done and leaves a key to the town vault.
- Town safe.
- ![2024-04-14-20240420153400906.webp|500](/img/user/Kingdom%20of%20Zemland/z_Attachments/2024-04-14-20240420153400906.webp)
	- 13,000GP.
	- 1 exceptionally large uncut diamond.
	- Several smaller gems


[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]]  tries to make the other understand that no matter what we do here in the town to resolve the slavery issue, it will just rise up again the second we leave town.  In a society where this type of behaviour is the norm and not outlawed, it will just come back by someone who wants the power and money we will have made vacant.

They don't want to listen.

The others make a plan to use the dungeons underneath the lighthouse as a trap for K's men in order to wipe them out.

A Drow and some Kobalds come down the stairs, probably a scouting party.  
- Rather than follow the plane, which was to wait for them to enter the chamber and attack them from multiple sides, [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]] frightens them off.
	- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  and [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Vaen Silversong\|Vaen Silversong]]  really have problems following agreed upon plans and totally screwing them up.
- Combat.
	- We win.

We wait for a period.

[[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Seraphina Shadowbloom\|Seraphina Shadowbloom]] traps the stairs.

Explosions on Stairs.

More come into the room.
- [[Kingdom of Zemland/1. PC's/Eirwen Sarkan\|Eirwen Sarkan]]  freezes a a patch of water in front of door.
	- One comes through and slips.
- combat.
	- We win.
	- This continues for a couple of waves
K is dead.....

The party wait.

Drow assassins sneaks in.
- Combat.
	- we win.

We return the town treasury to the vault - keeping some as a fee.
