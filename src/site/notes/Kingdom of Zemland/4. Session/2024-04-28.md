We head off to deliver the letter/message to Serackha

We head out of [[Kingdom of Zemland/3. Locations/Town/Stillrest\|Stillrest]].
- The town where Serackha lives is about an hours trip.
- Meet Serackha, hand over letter.
	- The letter contains a Medallion
		- The medallion is apparently the sign that a government meeting is to take place.
			- Why is a Bar Tender asking total strangers to deliver such an important token to someone obviously on the council.
				- If she is in the council, does this mean she is a member of [[Kingdom of Zemland/5. Lore/Organisations/The Hooded Ones\|The Hooded Ones]]
			- Why is a Bar Tender involved at all?
		- There is to be a meeting of the clans
			- What clans are there involved?

	- The Black Corsairs apparently have a horde of their own.
		- Possibly hidden on the Island
	- Rumours around the Black Corsairs.
	- Terrorists.
		- Possible part of the Crimson corsairs.
	- If the Black Corsairs are the bandits, and [[Kingdom of Zemland/5. Lore/Organisations/The Hooded Ones\|The Hooded Ones]] are in league with them, does this mean there is a civil war going on?

Go to government building.
- Looks like a long house.
