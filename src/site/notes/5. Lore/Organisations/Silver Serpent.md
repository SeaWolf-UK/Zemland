## Charter of the Silver Serpent

Article I: Purpose and Jurisdiction

The Silver Serpent, herein referred to as "The Serpent," is established to regulate and oversee all activities related to assassination, targeted eliminations, and specialized combat missions within the city of Dragons Tail and its surrounding territories. The Serpent operates under a strict code to ensure the success, secrecy, and precision of its members while maintaining the balance of power within the city and beyond.

Article II: Membership

1. Eligibility and Initiation:
- Membership in The Serpent is reserved for those who demonstrate exceptional skill in the arts of assassination, combat, and silent elimination. Prospective members must undergo a rigorous initiation process, which includes a series of trials designed to test their abilities, loyalty, and discretion.
- Upon successful completion of these trials, the initiate will swear an oath of loyalty to The Serpent and its leadership, binding them to the guild's rules and obligations.
    
2. Dues and Contributions:
- All members are required to contribute 10% of the payment received from any sanctioned operation to The Serpent. This contribution, known as the "management fee," ensures the continued operation and protection of the guild and its members.
- Failure to pay the management fee within the designated time will result in penalties, including but not limited to fines, suspension of guild privileges, or other disciplinary actions as deemed appropriate by the leadership.
    

Article III: Governance and Structure

1. Council of Fangs:
- The Serpent is governed by the Council of Fangs, a body composed of the most experienced and lethal members of the guild. The Council oversees all major decisions, including the approval of contracts, the allocation of resources, and the enforcement of guild laws.
 - The Council is led by the "Viper," the head of The Serpent, who holds ultimate authority within the guild. The Viper is responsible for maintaining the guild's operations, ensuring that all members adhere to the charter, and making final decisions on all matters.
 - The "Fang" serves as the second-in-command (2IC) to the Viper, acting as the vice president of the guild. The Fang is responsible for assisting the Viper in their duties, taking charge in their absence, and ensuring the efficient operation of the guild on a day-to-day basis. The Fang also has the authority to make decisions on behalf of The Serpent when immediate action is required.
    
2. Ranks and Titles:
- Members of The Serpent are organized into ranks based on their experience, skill, and contributions to the guild. These ranks include, but are not limited to, Initiate, Venom, Shade, and Specter. Advancement within the guild is determined by the Council of Fangs and is based on merit and loyalty.
 - Specific titles may be granted to members with specialized roles, such as "Keeper of Blades" (responsible for managing guild armaments) or "Keeper of Shadows" (responsible for high-risk assassination missions).

Article IV: Conduct and Discipline

1. Loyalty and Secrecy:
 - Members of The Serpent are expected to maintain the highest level of loyalty to the guild. Betrayal of the guild or its members, including sharing secrets or colluding with outside forces, is punishable by death.
- Secrecy is paramount. Members must not reveal their affiliation with The Serpent to anyone outside the guild without explicit permission from the Council of Fangs.
 
2. Sanctioned Operations:
- Only assassination operations sanctioned by the Council of Fangs may be undertaken by members of The Serpent. Unauthorized killings or other unsanctioned activities will result in severe punishment. Penalties for such offenses include the confiscation of assets, physical retribution, or execution, depending on the severity of the transgression.
 
3. Internal Disputes:
- Disputes between members must be brought before the Council of Fangs for arbitration. Members are forbidden from settling disputes through violence or other unsanctioned means. The Council's decisions are final and binding.

Article V: Duty to the City and Surrounding Area

1. Protection of Dragons Tail:
 - The Serpent recognizes the importance of maintaining the stability and prosperity of Dragons Tail and its surrounding territories. In times of danger or crisis, The Serpent shall act in the best interest of the city and its people, using its resources and influence to protect the city from threats both internal and external.
- The Serpent may coordinate with other organizations, including those outside the law, to ensure the safety and continued operation of the city. While The Serpent’s primary focus remains its own interests, the well-being of Dragons Tail is paramount to ensuring those interests can thrive.
    

2. Strategic Alliances:
- The Serpent may form temporary alliances with other factions or entities within the city to combat common threats. Such alliances must be approved by the Viper or the Fang and should be entered with caution to avoid compromising the guild’s secrecy and autonomy.

2. Safehouses and Resources:
 - The Serpent maintains a network of safehouses, supply caches, and other resources throughout Dragons Tail, which are available to members as needed. Access to these resources is granted based on rank and need, as determined by the Council of Fangs.
